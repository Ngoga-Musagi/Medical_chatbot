Acknowledgement
The Ministry of Health wishes to acknowledge the support of various stakeholders in
the making of the 2022 Standards Treatment Guidelines (STGs) and Essential Medicines List (EML). Without their contributions, it wouldn’t have been possible to complete this work despite the restrictions made necessary by the Covid-19 Pandemics.
The World Health Organization availed the required financial and technical support
throughout the project and was flexible to adjust to the challenges brought about by
the stringent environment.
World AIDS Campaign International (WACI) Health made a significant financial input
to allowing a smooth running of the project.
The Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceutical services program (USAID MTaPS)
financial intervention especially in the shaping of the rational use of antibiotic guidelines has been a great input in the current work.
Clinton health access initiative (CHAI) have been instrumental and played a major
role especially in developing the Clinical guidelines for hypoxemia screening and oxygen therapy administration in Neonates, children and adults.
The Ministry wishes to thank specifically all Rwanda Health professionals and Pharmacy Societies and Associations for their self-less spirit and gave their time to patiently review and update the previous 2013 STGs and 2015 EML spending very long
hours online very often late in the night.
The Ministry of Health wishes to acknowledge and thank the consultants, Prof Emile
Rwamasirabo, Dr. Raymond Muganga and Dr. Richard Butare who coordinated this
2022 STG/EML updates.
The Ministry also recognizes the important contribution of tertiary Hospitals including CHUK, CHUB and KFH that availed their microbiology data over 5 to 7 years that
helped to profiling the antimicrobial resistance in Rwanda.
Special recognition goes also to the Experts Taskforce appointed by the MOH upon
recommendation by the Medical and Pharmacy Societies and Associations. The team
is composed as follows:
Societies and Associations Coordinators
1 The Rwanda Pediatric Association (RPA) Prof. Musiime S.
2. The Rwanda College of Physicians (RCP) Dr. Muvunyi B.
2 The Rwanda Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology
(RSOG)
Dr. Ruzigana G.
3 The Rwanda Surgical Society Dr. Byiringiro F.

RESPIRATORY DISEASES
--|Rhinitis and rhinopharyngitis
Definition
Rhinitis and rhinopharyngitis are very common viral infections of the nasal or pharyngeal
mucosa, which occur with seasonal variations under 5 year olds (more frequent in cold and
rainy seasons).
Causes
•	 Commonest virus: Rhinoviruses
•	 Other viruses: Coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumovirus,
influenza viruses, para influenza viruses, adenoviruses, enteroviruses rarely
•	 Other causes include allergy (in case of recurrence), Iron deficiency, Passive tobacco smoke
Signs and symptoms:
•	 Nasal congestion
•	 Sore throat
•	 Sneezing
•	 Productive Cough
•	 Fever sometimes
•	 Watery red eyes
•	 Headache
Note: Suspect allergic rhinitis in case of recurrent signs of rhinitis with itching of nose, eyes, ears
and palate.
Complications
•	 Otitis media
•	 Sinusitis (over 6 year old age)
•	 Tonsillitis
•	 Exacerbation of asthma
Management
At health centre
Investigations
•	 Malaria test and FBC/ Hb if fever is present
Treatment
•	 No specific treatment
•	 Nasal irrigation with 0.9% sodium chloride, 4 to 6 times/ day to clear the airway.
•	 Patients with fever give paracetamol as follow 10 to 15 mg/kg/dose 4-6 hourly (maximum
dose 60mg/kg/day),
•	 Air humidification using nebulization with 0.9% sodium chloride may help open the airways,
thin secretions, and loosen mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up or clear
•	 For allergic rhinitis only, give an antihistamine: Desloratadine for 3 to 5 days as follow:
o From 2 to 5 years: 1.25mg once a day
o Children from 6 to 12 years: 2.5 mg Once a day
o Children >12 years: 5 mg Once a day
o Avoiding the allergen
At district hospital level (Same as above)

--| Wheezing child: bronchiolitis
Definition
A wheeze is a musical and continuous sound that originates from oscillations in narrowed airways.
Wheezing is heard mostly in expiration as a result of critical airway obstruction.
Causes/ differential diagnosis:
•	 Bronchiolitis
•	 Asthma
•	 Oesophageal foreign bodies
•	 Aspiration syndrome (gastro-oesophageal reflux diseases)
Definition: Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the small airways due to acute viral infection affecting
children below 2 years of age. It occurs with seasonal variations and may lead to fatal respiratory
distress. Recurrent episodes of wheeze associated with bronchiolitis may occur, and some of these
children may develop asthma.
Causes
•	 Respiratory Syncytial Virus is the most common (>50% cases)
•	 Other agents: parainfluenza, adenovirus, Mycoplasma, and, occasionally, other viruses
especially Human metapneumovirus
Clinical signs
•	 Mild Bronchiolitis
o Cough and fast breathing (tachypnoea).
•	 Moderate Bronchiolitis: As above plus one of the following:
o Lower chest wall in-drawing;
o Nasal flaring;
o Grunting
•	 Severe Bronchiolitis: As above plus at least one of the following:
o Central cyanosis, oxygen saturation < 90% in room air;
o Inability to feed;
o Convulsions, lethargy or decreased level of consciousness;
o Severe respiratory distress (e.g. very severe chest wall in-drawing).
o Silent chest on auscultation (corresponding to an intense bronchospasm
Risk factors for severe bronchiolitis:
•	 Age less than 3 months
•	 Ex-preterm infants
•	 Chronic lung disease
•	 Congenital heart disease
Diagnosis: Is on clinical basis
•	 Prodrome of viral infection: irritability and rhinorrhoea.
•	 A wheeze that is slowly responsive or non-responsive to bronchodilators.
•	 Crepitations and signs of hyperinflation of the chest.
•	 Chest X-ray should be reserved for clinically severe or complicated cases
•	 Tachypnoea: age dependent:
7
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Investigations
•	 FBC
•	 CRP (Less contributory as viral infection)
•	 Chest X-ray: (Not mandatory) show hyperinflated lungs with patchy atelectasis
Complications:
•	 Bacterial secondary infection
•	 Atelectasis
•	 Apnoea especially in neonatal and infant period
•	 ARDS
Management: In Bronchiolitis treatment is symptomatic
At health centre level:
Outpatient management
•	 Nasal irrigation with 0.9% NaCl before each feed
•	 Small, frequent feedings to reduce vomiting triggered by bouts of coughing.
•	 Increased fluids if fever and/or significant secretions are present.
•	 Treat fever with paracetamol 10-15mg/kg/dose 6 hourly
•	 Counsel the care giver and advise to come back if the child deteriorates or does not
improve.
•	 Transfer all children with one of the following criteria to hospital:
o Presence of any sign of severity
o Pre-existing pathology (cardiac, Respiratory, malnutrition, HIV, etc.)
o Associated acute pathology (viral gastro-enteritis, bacterial infection, etc.)
o Age less than 3 months
At district hospital level
Hospitalize children if signs of serious illness
•	 Administer high humidified oxygen at 8L/min in 30 to 40 % oxygen
•	 Maintenance IV fluid
•	 Tube feeding when the respiratory distress improves
•	 In case of respiratory failure, use non-invasive naso CPAP or mechanical ventilation
Recommendation
•	 Antibiotic treatment only indicated for children with secondary infection according to

Diagnosis:
Asthma is diagnosed on the basis of a patient’s symptoms and medical history.
 Presence of any of these signs and symptoms should increase the suspicion of asthma:
•	 Wheezing: high-pitched whistling sounds when breathing out-especially in children. (A
normal chest examination does not exclude asthma.)
•	 History of any of the following:
o Cough, worse particularly at night
o Recurrent wheeze
o Recurrent difficulty in breathing
o Recurrent chest tightness
•	 Symptoms occur or worsen at night, awakening the patient.
•	 Symptoms occur or worsen in a seasonal pattern.
•	 The patient also has eczema, hay fever, or a family history of asthma or atopic diseases.
•	 Symptoms occur or worsen in the presence of:
o Strong emotional expression Animals with fur
o Aerosol chemicals
o Changes in temperature

RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
o Domestic dust mites
o Drugs (aspirin, beta blockers)
o Exercise
o Pollen
o Respiratory (viral) infections
o Smoke
•	 Symptoms respond to anti-asthma therapy
•	 Patients colds “go to the chest” or take more than 10 days to clear up
Investigations:
•	 FBC for exclusion of super-infection
•	 Chest X-ray ( where available for differential diagnosis and i
•	 Additional diagnostic tests:
•	 Lung function to confirm diagnosis and assess severity (where available)
•	 Peak expiratory flow rate can help diagnosis and follow up
Complication:
•	 Uncontrolled/poorly controlled asthma can lead to severe lung damage
•	 Severe asthma exacerbation can cause respiratory failure and death
Management:
Asthma exacerbation (asthma attacks) are episodes of a progressive increase in shortness of
breath, cough, wheezing or chest tightness or a combination of these symptoms.
•	 Asthma attacks require prompt treatment
•	 Categorize severity of attach and treat as per ETAT+ guidelines below
Very Severe Asthma
Any one with;
•	 Oxygen saturation <90%
•	 Central cyanosis
•	 Silent chest
•	 Inability to drink / breast feed
•	 AVPU= “V”, “P” or “U” or
•	 Inability to talk/complete sentences
•	 Pulse rate >200 bpm (0-3 years) and >180 bpm (4-5yrs)
Immediate Management
ADMIT
•	 Oxygen
•	 Nebulize 2.5 mg salbutamol or 6 puffs of Inhaler with spacer and mask give every 20
minutes up to 3 doses if needed
•	 Prednisolone 2mg/kg OR
•	 IVI Hydrocortisone 4mg/kg if unable to take orally
Alternative treatment:
•	 Ipratropium bromide (if available): nebulization increases effect of salbutamol or
Combivent (Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate)
•	 Adrenaline in case of anaphylaxis but not indicated for asthma attack (10µg/kg IM
then infusion 0.1µg/kg/min)
Moderate to Severe asthmatic attack:
•	 Wheeze
•	 Lower chest wall indrawing
11
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Immediate Management

•	 Salbutamol by nebulizer or
•	 Inhaler + spacer + mask repeated up to 10 puffs in 30min min (shake inhaler every 2
puffs)
•	 Start oral prednisolone at 2mg/kg for 3-5 days. Max dose of 20mg/day for < 2 years
and 30mg/day for 2-5 years.
Reassess after 30-60 min and reclassify severity – if now:
•	 Very severe
o Continue oxygen, 1-4 hourly salbutamol, early review, antibiotics as for very
severe pneumonia
•	 Severe
o 4 hourly salbutamol, antibiotics as for severe pneumonia
•	 Mild:
o 4 hourly salbutamol, oral antibiotics aim for discharge in 24 hr
Mild asthmatic attack:
•	 Wheeze PLUS
•	 Fast breathing (RR 50 aged 2-11 months RR 40 aged 12-59 months)
Management of mild asthmatic attack
•	 Salbutamol by inhaler, spacer + mask
•	 Reassess respiratory rate after 20-30 minutes, if persistently elevated consider oral
antibiotic
•	 Counsel caregiver on signs of deterioration and schedule review within 48 hours
•	 Give education on use of inhaler, spacer + mask
•	 Discharge on salbutamol inhaler 4-6 hourly for no more than 5 days
NOTE:
•	 In recurrence of asthma symptoms consider inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy or adjust
the doses if already on ICS and look out for other comorbidities
•	 Demonstrate MDI and spacer use to the caregiver before discharge
•	 Preferably use spacer with face masks for <3 years for 4-5 years use facemask or
mouthpiece.
•	 Advise on regular follow up
Maintenance treatment: see tables below
Clinical initial check- up
•	 Check risk factors
•	 Patient education: Discuss the management plan, importance of adherence to treatment
•	 Medication: inhaled corticosteroids. Example: start with Beclomethasone inhaled 250μg,
once to twice a day with inhalation chamber then step up or step down according to the
evolution (close follow up after discharge)
•	 Treatment of co-morbid conditions (Rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux)

--|Laryngotracheobronchitis
Definition
Inflammation of the vocal cords and structures inferior to the cords. It is the common cause of
stridor in children aged between 6 months and 2 years leading to potentially life-threatening
airway obstruction.
Causes:
•	 Viral respiratory tract infection: Parainfluenza Virus Type 1 and 2, Rhinoviruses, Syncytial
Viruses, adenoviruses, measles and herpes simplex….)
Signs and Symptoms:
•	 Progressive shortness of breath following upper respiratory tract infection in a previously
well child, followed by a barking cough and stridor
•	 Stridor becomes softer as airway obstruction becomes more severe
•	 There may be a sore throat
•	 Mild fever may be present
•	 Erythema and oedema of larynx
The following features suggest a different diagnosis:
•	 Acute onset of obstruction without prodromal features (foreign body or angioneurotic
oedema)
•	 incomplete immunisation and a membrane in the upper airway (diphtheria),
•	 High fever, dysphagia, drooling or sitting position (epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess,
bacterial tracheitis)
•	 Recurrent upper airways obstruction (laryngeal papilloma).
Assessment of severity of airway obstruction in LTB
•	 Grade 1: Inspiratory stridor
•	 Grade 2 : Inspiratory and Expiratory stridor and passive expiration
•	 Grade 3 : Inspiratory and Expiratory stridor + pulsus paradoxus and active expiration
•	 Grade 4 : cyanosis, apathy, marked retractions, impending cardiorespiratory arrest
Diagnosis:
•	 Clinical signs as above
•	 Investigations:
o FBC + CRP
o Lateral Neck X-ray (not mandatory)
Management:
Leave child in carer’s arms as much as possible
(except if near respiratory arrest) as you manage the child
Supportive measures
•	 Humidified O2 therapy
•	 Monitor oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate
•	 Maintenance fluids and nutrition
•	 Avoid unnecessary stimulation
•	 Depending on severity, admit child to high care or intensive care ward.

--|Pertussis (whooping cough)
Definition
This is a highly infectious form of bronchitis caused by bordetella pertussis. It has become rare
since vaccination but it is endemic with epidemics every 3-4 years. Particular attention to young
infants (before complete vaccination), adults (weaning effect of vaccine) and unvaccinated.
Cause: Bordetella pertussis
Signs/symptoms:
After one week of coryza (catarrhal phase), the child develops a characteristic paroxysmal
cough followed by characteristic inspiratory whoop (paroxysmal phase, 3-6 weeks). Worse at
night and occasional vomiting. During paroxysm, the face goes red or blue and mucus flows from
nose and mouth. May cause apnoea in young infants. The symptoms gradually decrease and
may persists for months (convalescent phase)
Diagnosis:

TREATMENT GUIDELINES
--|Amoebiasis
Definition
Amoebiasis is a parasitic infection due to the intestinal protozoa Entamoeba histolytic.
Transmission is faecal-oral, by ingestion of amoebic cysts from food or water contaminated
with faeces. Usually, ingested cysts release non-pathogenic amoebae and 90% of carriers are
asymptomatic. In 10% of infected patients, pathogenic amoebae penetrate the mucous of the
colon: this is the intestinal amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery). The clinical picture is similar to that
of shigellosis, which is the principal cause of dysentery. Occasionally, the pathogenic amoebae
migrate via the blood stream and form peripheral abscesses. Amoebic liver abscess is the most
common form of extra-intestinal amoebiasis.
Clinical features
•	 Amoebic dysentery
o Diarrhoea containing red blood and mucus
o Abdominal pain, tenesmus
o No fever or mild fever
o Possibly signs of dehydration
•	 Amoebic liver abscess
o Painful hepatomegaly; mild jaundice may be present
o Anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting
o Intermittent fever, sweating, chills; change in overall condition
Laboratory
•	 Amoebic dysentery: identification of mobile trophozoites (E. histolytica) in fresh stool samples
•	 Amoebic liver abscess: indirect haemoagglutination and ELISA
Treatment for Amoebic dysentery
Tinidazole PO
•	 Children: 50 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (max. 2 g daily)
•	 Adolescents: 2 g once daily for 3 days OR
Metronidazole PO
•	 Children: 15 mg/kg 3 times daily for 5 days
•	 Adolescents: 500 mg 3 times daily for 5 days
Note:
•	 If there is no laboratory, first line treatment for dysentery is for shigellosis
•	 Treat for amoebiasis if correct treatment for shigellosis has been ineffective
•	 The presence of cysts alone should not lead to the treatment of amoebiasis.
•	 Amoebiasis is confirmed with a parasitological stool examination: mobile trophozoites in
fresh stool
--|Constipation
Definition
Constipation is an acute or chronic condition in which bowel movements occur less often than
usual or consist of hard, dry stools that are painful or difficult to pass.

•	 Rendu Osler syndrome
•	 Gastric polyps
•	 Oesophageal varices
34
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Clinical manifestations:
•	 Hematemesis
•	 Melena
•	 Other signs according to the causative agent
Assessment:
History: The clinical history should include information concerning:
•	 The time course of the bleeding episode
•	 Estimated blood loss, and any associated symptoms.
•	 Gastrointestinal symptoms including dyspepsia, heartburn, abdominal pain, dysphagia, and
weight loss. In infants, these features may be reflected in poor feeding and irritability.
The history should also include information about the following symptoms or signs which may
provide clues to an underlying disorder:
•	 Recent onset of jaundice, easy bruising or change in stool color, which may suggest underlying
liver disease
•	 Recent or recurrent epistaxis, to investigate the possibility of a nasopharyngeal source of
bleeding
•	 History of easy bruising or bleeding, which suggests a disorder of coagulation, platelet
dysfunction, or thrombocytopenia
•	 Personal or family history or liver, kidney or heart disease, or coagulation disorders
•	 A drug history is important to assess potential contributions from medications that may induce
ulceration (such as NSAIDs and corticosteroids); Tetracyclines, may cause a pill esophagitis
•	 If the patient has been taking drugs or has a cardiac condition that affects homeostatic
responses (such as beta-adrenergic antagonists), because these may mask tachycardia
associated with life-threatening hypovolemia and shock.
Physical examination: The physical examination should include the following elements:
•	 The skin for cutaneous signs of generalized vascular malformations/disorders (cutaneous
hemangiomas. mucocutaneous telangiectasia)
•	 Evidence of portal hypertension, (splenomegaly, prominent abdominal and haemorrhoid
vessels)
•	 Inspection of the nasopharynx
•	 Check for hemodynamic failure (signs of shock?)
Nasogastric tube:
•	 Sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis and determine if the bleeding is ongoing.
•	 The lavage will also remove particulate matter, fresh blood, and clots to facilitate endoscopy
and decrease the risk of aspiration.
•	 Ice water lavage (an older practice) does not slow bleeding and may induce iatrogenic
hypothermia, particularly in infants and small children, and is not recommended
Differentials:
•	 Swallowed maternal blood during delivery or while nursing
•	 Ingested epistaxis – nasopharynx bleeding
Investigations:
Depending on suspected cause and magnitude of the blood loss, laboratory assessment
should include:
•	 FBC, cross-match blood in case transfusion is required , LFTs, blood urea nitrogen, serum
creatinine , Coagulation tests
•	 Upper digestive endoscopy (diagnosis and interventional).
35
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Management:
Main objectives:
•	 Relieve or treat haemorrhagic shock if present
•	 Stop bleeding
•	 Treat the causative agent
Emergency treatment
•	 ABC (include Blood transfusion if necessary)
•	 Insert a nasogastric tube for aspiration and an IV line (big enough for age).
•	 If the haemodynamic state is stable (pulse and blood pressure are normal):
o Hydrate (Ringer lactate), monitor vitals, keep NPO for 12 hours.
o If there is no active haemorrhage, restart oral feeding after 12 hours
•	 Assess for possible causative agent and treat accordingly.
•	 If need of endoscopy, then refer to centre where it’s available.
Most common causes according to age and treatment
•	 Neonates (Stress ulcers secondary to severe illness):
o Cimetidine IV 5-20mg/kg divided in 2 doses OR Ranitidine IV 2mg/kg/24 divided in
2-3 doses
o Omeprazole, PO 0.5–1 mg/kg, 12– 24 hourly
•	 Infants and toddlers (common cause is gastric ulcers and other causes can be evaluated
after endoscopy)
o Octreotide, IV bolus, 1–2 mcg then 1–5 mcg/kg/hour by infusion, initiated by the
specialist in case of cases of variceal bleeding ( difficult to control, to help control
bleeding before endoscopy, or when endoscopy is unsuccessful, contraindicated, or
unavailable)
o Omeprazole, PO
	1 month–2 years 2.5mg, 12 hourly
	2–6 years 5 mg, 12 hourly initiated by the Specialist for post bleed prophylactic
management
•	 Old children and adolescent (common cause is gastric ulcers and other causes can be
evaluated after endoscopy)
o Omeprazole, PO < 20 kg: 10 mg QD >20 kg : 20 mg QD
Note: Endoscopy is recommended to be performed within 24 to 48 hours for infants and children
presenting with upper GIT bleeding that is acute and severe, it can be performed for diagnosis and
treatment (sclerotherapy in oesophageal variceal)
Alternative treatment:
•	 Propranolol oral, 2–8 mg/kg/24 hours in 3 divided doses (to reduce the pulse rate by 25%)
•	 Surgical oversewing if endoscopy and sclerotherapy or banding have failed
Recommendations:
•	 Refer all cases to the specialist for appropriate diagnosis and treatment
•	 Refer all bleeding varices - after commencement of resuscitation and octreotide, if available
--|Peptic Ulcer Disease
Definition
This refers to ulceration of gastric or duodenal mucosa that tends to be chronic and/or recurrent.

or associated with NSAID use).
36
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Signs and Symptoms:
•	 Peptic ulcers may present with dyspeptic or other gastrointestinal symptoms or may be
completely asymptomatic, sometimes until complications such as haemorrhage or perforation
occur. The symptoms associated with peptic ulcers are not sensitive or specific and the
differential diagnosis is broad.
•	 Most common: Ulcer-like or acid dyspepsia (burning pain; epigastric hunger-like pain; relief
with food, antacids, and/or anti-secretory agents)
•	 Food-provoked dyspepsia or indigestion (postprandial epigastric discomfort and fullness,
belching, early satiety, nausea, and occasional vomiting) : food-stimulated acid secretion
persists for three to five hours; thus, classic DU symptoms occur two to five hours after meals
•	 Reflux-like dyspepsia
Cause:
•	 Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) -In developing nations, the majority of children are infected
with H. pylori before the age of 10
Diagnosis:
Clinical symptoms:
•	 Epigastric pain. Pain is often poorly localised in children, described as dull and aching and
frequently does not respond to antacids
•	 Haematemesis or melena is a relatively common presentation in children (up to 50%).
Investigations
•	 Stool analysis for occult blood
•	 FBC
•	 For Helicobacter Pylori:
o It is recommended that the initial diagnosis of H. pylori infection be based on positive
histopathology plus positive rapid urease test, or positive culture.
o A validated ELISA for detection of H. pylori antigen in stool is a reliable non-invasive test
to determine whether H. pylorus has been eradicated.
o Tests based on the detection of antibodies (IgG, IgA) against H. pylori in serum,
whole blood, urine and saliva are less reliable for use in the clinical setting.
NB: specialists recommend: In children with refractory iron deficiency anaemia, where other causes
have been ruled out, testing for H. pylori infection may be considered (Grade of evidence: low)
Complications:
The natural history of peptic ulcer ranges from resolution without intervention to development
of complications : acute or Chronic blood loss or perforation
•	 Iron deficiency anaemia
Management:
•	 Avoid any foods that cause pain to the patient’s (e.g. acid foods, cola drinks)
•	 Avoid gastric irritating drugs (NSAIDs)
•	 Give magnesium-based antacids or combined magnesium-aluminium
First line H pylori eradication regimens are:
•	 Triple therapy with a PPI + Amoxicillin + Imidazole;
•	 or PPI + Amoxicillin + Clarithromycin;
•	 or Bismuth salts + Amoxicillin + Imidazole;
•	 or Sequential Therapy Triple therapy for eradication of H. pylori by;
o Omeprazole PO

--|Gastroesophageal reflux
Definition
GER is the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus with or without regurgitation and
vomiting. GER is a normal physiologic process occurring several times per day in healthy infants,
children, and adults. Most episodes of GER in healthy individuals last <3 minutes, occur in
the postprandial period, and cause few or no symptoms. In contrast, Gastroesophageal reflux
disease GERD is present when the reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms and/
or complications.
Causes and risk factors:
•	 The cause is still unclear
•	 Anatomical abnormalities such as a hiatal hernia
•	 Long term use of nasal gastric tube
•	 Diet that stimulates gastric acid production
•	 Neurologic impairment (NI), obesity, certain genetic syndromes, esophageal atresia (EA),
chronic lung diseases, and those with a history of premature birth
Diagnosis: Based os Signs and Symptoms:
In infants and toddlers, there is no symptom or symptom complex that is diagnostic of GERD
or predicts response to therapy. In older children and adolescents, as in adult patients, history
and physical examination may be sufficient to diagnose GERD if the symptoms are typical. The
following suggestive:
•	 In newborn:
o Recurrent vomiting, stridor, apnoea
•	 In infant:
o Recurrent vomiting
o Respiratory manifestations, (dry cough, recurrent wheeze or cough, chronic obstructive
airway disease, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, stridor, apnoea
38
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 In children /adolescent:
o Heartburn, Epigastric or chest pain.
o Respiratory manifestations: dry cough, recurrent wheeze or cough, chronic obstructive
airway disease,
Complications:
•	 Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing)
•	 Odynophagia (pain on swallowing)
•	 Weight loss
•	 Anaemia
•	 Esophagitis
•	 Aspiration pneumonia
•	 Barrett’s esophagus
•	 Abnormal posturing or opisthotonus (Sandifer syndrome)
Investigations: when GER is persisting despite basic management
•	 24 hours esophageal PH monitoring
•	 Endoscopy with biopsy to rule out esophagitis
•	 Barium X-rays for severity of oesophageal stenosis
•	 FBC look for anaemia
Management:
Non-pharmacological management
•	 Postural treatment: prone and lateral positions are associated with an increased incidence
of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The risk of SIDS outweighs the benefit of prone
or lateral sleep position on GER; therefore, in most infants from birth to 12 months of age,
supine positioning during sleep is recommended.
•	 Dietary measures such as thickened food – if not breastfeeding, frequent small volume of
solid foods
Pharmacological management
Less Severe or Non-Erosive;
•	 Anti-acids
o Sodium alginate (Gaviscon Enfant)/antacid combination
o 1-2 months 1.5 mls after each meal
o 2-4 months 2mls after each meal
•	 Aluminium and Magnesium hydroxide (Maalox) Syrup 0.5 ml/kg/dose PO QID
•	 H2 Antagonists: Cimetidine IV/syrup/tab
o Neonates 5-20mg/kg/24 hr divided in 2 doses
o Infants 10-20 mg/kg/24hrs divided in 2 doses
o Children 20-40mg/kg/24hr divided in 2 doses
Severe or Erosive
•	 Omeprazole, oral;
o Neonate 0.5–1 mg/kg, 12– 24 hourly
o Children 1- 16 years :
	5 kg to <10 kg: 5 mg once daily
	10 kg to ≤20 kg: 10 mg once daily

 Acute Rheumatic Fever
Definition
This is an acute, systemic connective tissue disease in children related to an immune reaction to
untreated group A Beta haemolytic streptococcus infection of the upper respiratory tract .The
initial attack of acute rheumatic fever occurs in most cases between the ages of 3 and 15 years.
It is the autoimmune reaction that damages the heart valves leading to Rheumatic heart diseases
Cause: Auto-immune disease
Table 15. Revised Jones Criteria
Major manifestations: Minor manifestations: Group A Strep(GAS) Infection:
Carditis Fever GAS on throat swab (culture)
Arthritis Arthralgia Raised Anti-streptolysin O titre
(ASOT)
Sydenham’s Chorea Prolonged P-R
interval on ECG
Raised Anti-deoxyribonuclease B
(Anti-DNase B)
Erythema marginatum Raised ESR or CRP
Subcutaneous nodules
Criteria for ARF diagnosis according to WHO
	The first episode of ARF can be confirmed if:
o 2 MAJOR, or 1 MAJOR and 2 MINOR manifestations are present plus evidence of
preceding Group A streptococcal infection.
	Recurrent ARF (with no RHD) can be confirmed if
o 2 MAJOR, or 1 MAJOR and 2 MINOR manifestations are present plus evidence of
preceding Group A streptococcal infection.
	Recurrent ARF (with existing RHD) can be confirmed if
o 2 MINOR manifestations are present plus evidence of preceding Group A
streptococcal infection.
Note:
•	 Chorea for which other causes have been excluded, provides adequate evidence of
rheumatic fever without the other criteria for diagnosis being required.
•	 In children with rheumatic heart disease with fever, it is critical to differentiate recurrence of
acute rheumatic fever from infective endocarditis (IE).
•	 For children with rheumatic heart disease, recurrence of some of the above criteria would
suggest a recurrence of rheumatic fever but other causes such as IE should be excluded.
Diagnosis is made on clinical basis
Investigations
•	 Throat swab for culture (positive throat culture of group A Streptoccocal infection)
•	 Raised ASOT/ASLO antibodies titre (Anti-streptolysin-0-titre – ASOT of 1:300)
•	 Anti DNase B
•	 FBC/ ESR/CRP
•	 Chest x-ray – Features of cardiomegaly
•	 ECG
•	 Echocardiogram
48
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Complications: Rheumatic heart disease
Management:
•	 The primary goal of treating an ARF attack is to eradicate streptococcal organisms and
bacterial antigens from the pharyngeal region
•	 Persons with symptoms of ARF should be hospitalized to ensure accurate diagnosis, and to
receive clinical care and education about preventing further episodes of ARF.
•	 The diagnosis should include an initial echocardiogram used to help identify and measure
heart valvular damage.
•	 Long-term preventative management should be organized before discharge.
•	 All cases of ARF should receive:
o A single injection of Benzathine penicillin G (Extencilline): 25,000–50,000 units/kg/
dose stat; maximum 1.2 mega units dose OR
o Oral Penicillin (Pen V) 25–50mg/kg/day in divided 3 doses for 10 days (Erythromycin
30-50mg/kg/day divided in 3 doses if penicillin allergy)
Relief of symptoms
Arthritis and fever
•	 Aspirin 75–100mg/kg/day in 4–6 divided doses. Treatment continued until fever and joint
inflammation are controlled and then gradually reduced over a 2-week period
•	 Add an antacid to reduce risk of gastric irritation e.g Omeprazole 1mg/kgOr
•	 Prednisolone 1-2mg/kg OD for 2 weeks then taper for 2 weeks with good response
begiAspirin in the 3rd week and continue until 8th week tapering in the final 2 weeks
Chorea
•	 Most mild-moderate cases do not need medication
•	 Provide calm and supportive environment (prevent accidental self-harm)
For severe cases:
•	 Carbamazepine per os:
o <6 years: 10-20mg/kg/day divided in 3 doses,
o Y-ears: 400-800mg/day divided in 3 doses,
o >12 years: 200mg x 2/day
•	 Valproic acid 20-30mg/kg/day divided in 2 doses
•	 Duration: 2 weeks
Carditis
•	 Bed rest if in cardiac failure
•	 Anti-failure medication as above
•	 Anti-coagulation medication if atrial fibrillation is present
Management plan when the acute episode is controlled
•	 Administer the first dose of secondary prophylaxis
•	 Register the individual with the local health authority or RHD Programme;
•	 Provide disease education for the person with ARF and the family
o Understanding of ARF and RHD and risks of ARF recurrence
o Importance of regular secondary prophylaxis and medical review
o Recognising own signs and symptoms of ARF and RHD
o Risks associated with future RHD (e.g. pregnancy, surgery and high level of aftercare)
o Importance of dental health
49

Recommendation: All patients with pericardial effusion should be referred to a cardiologist
--|Hypertension in children
Definition
Hypertension is defined as systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ the 95th percentile for
gender, age and height percentile on at least three consecutive occasions.
A sustained blood pressure of > 115/80 is abnormal in children between 6 weeks and 6 years
of age.
Hypertensive emergency/crisis exists when CNS signs of hypertension appear such as
encephalopathy, convulsions, retinal haemorrhages or blindness. Great care is required to
reduce the blood pressure in a controlled manner to avoid potentially serious consequences of
impaired auto-regulation of cerebral blood flow.
Hypertensive urgency is defined as a significant elevation of blood pressure without accompanying
end organ damage. Patients are generally symptomatic with complaints of headache, blurred
vision and nausea, despite the lack of end organ involvement
Accurate measurement of BP:
•	 Use the widest cuff that can be applied to the upper arm
•	 The cuff bladder must encircle at least 80% of the upper arm and should cover at least
75% of the distance between the elbow and the shoulder joints
•	 It is better to use a cuff that is slightly too large than one that is too small
Causes:
•	 Severe hypertension suggests renal disease
•	 Coarctation of aorta
•	 Rarely pheochromocytoma
•	 Long term steroid therapy
Most common causes of secondary hypertension by age:
New born:
•	 Renal abnormalities
•	 Coarctation of the aorta
•	 Renal artery stenosis
•	 Renal artery or veinal thrombosis
First year:
•	 Coarctation of the aorta
•	 Renal vascular desease
•	 Tumor
•	 Medications (steroids…)

•	 Amlodipine, oral, 0.2 mg/kg/dose. May be repeated 6 hours later, thereafter every 12
hours.
•	 Refer the patient to a specialist when the patient is stable
Recommendations:
•	 For acute or chronic hypertension blood pressure needs to be lowered cautiously
•	 Aim to reduce the SBP slowly over the next 24 - 48 hours
•	 Do not decrease BP to < 95th percentile in first 24 hours
•	 Advise a change in lifestyle
•	 Institute and monitor a weight reduction programme for obese individuals
•	 Regular aerobic exercise is recommended in essential hypertension

•	 Advise against smoking in teenager
•	 Follow up to monitor blood pressure and educate patient on hypertension
•	 If blood pressure decreases, continue with non-drug management and follow up
•	 If BP is increasing progressively, reinvestigate to exclude secondary causes or refer to the
specialist
59
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 If BP is stable but persistently > 95th percentile and secondary causes have been excluded,
start drug treatment after failed non-drug management for 6 months

RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Recommendations:
•	 All patients with hypertension and persistent proteinuria should be treated with an ACE
inhibitor
•	 Always exclude bilateral renal artery stenosis before treating with an ACE inhibitor
•	 Renal function must be monitored when an ACE inhibitor is prescribed because it may cause
a decline in GFR resulting in deterioration of renal function and hyperkalaemia
•	 Patients with hypertension due to a neuro-secretory tumour (phaeochromocytoma or
neuroblastoma), should receive an α-blocker either as single drug or in combination with
ß-adrenergic blocker
•	 For patients with persistent hypertension despite the use of first line drugs, a second/third
drug should be added
•	 Specific classes of antihypertensive drugs should be used according to the underlying
pathogenesis or illness
•	 For patients with predominantly fluid overload: use diuretics with/without ß-blocker

--|Urinary tract infection (UTI)
Definition
UTI is significant bacteriuria of a clinically relevant uropathogen in a symptomatic patient.
It is classified as:
•	 Uncomplicated UTI (Cystitis), which is the inflammation and infection of the bladder to the
bladder and urethra OR
•	 Complicated urinary tract infection (Pyelonephritis), an infection of the urinary tract involving
the renal parenchyma
 Acute cystitis
•	 Affects mainly girls from 2 years of age and there are no associated urological anomalies
•	 Escherichia coli is the causative pathogen in at least 70% of cases. Other pathogens include
Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus sp, and Klebsiella sp
Clinical features
Signs and symptoms are related to the age of the child and often non-specific.
•	 Burning sensation/pain on urination, urinary urgency and frequency; in children: crying when
passing urine; involuntary loss of urine, cloudy urine and lower abdominal discomfort. PLUS
•	 No fever (or mild fever), no flank pain; no systemic signs and symptoms in children.
It is essential to rule out pyelonephritis
The symptom ‘burning pain on urination’ alone is insufficient to make the diagnosis.
Laboratory
Urine dipstick test:
•	 Perform dipstick analysis for nitrites (which indicate the presence of enterobacteria) and
leukocytes (which indicate an inflammation) in the urine.
•	 If dipstick analysis is negative for both nitrites and leukocytes, a urinary infection is unlikely.
•	 If dipstick analysis is positive for nitrites and/or leukocytes, a urinary infection is likely.
•	 Microscopy/culture: when a dipstick analysis is positive, it is recommended to carry out urine
microscopy/culture in order to confirm the infection and identify the causative pathogen,
particularly in children and pregnant women.
•	 When urine microscopy is not feasible, an empirical antibiotherapy should be administered
to patients with typical signs of cystitis and positive dipstick urinalysis (leucocytes and/or
nitrites).
Treatment
Cystitis in girls 2 years and above:
•	 Cefixime PO: 8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days Or
•	 Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid PO 25 mg/kg 2 times daily for 3 days
65
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
 Acute pyelonephritis
•	 Pyelonephritis is more common in females.
•	 May be associated with underlying congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract.
•	 It may result in significant short-term morbidity, including septicaemic shock and acute renal
failure, especially in infants.
•	 Permanent renal damage may occur in children who have recurring episodes of pyelonephritis.
•	 The pathogens causing pyelonephritis are the same as those causing cystitis above
•	 Pyelonephritis is potentially severe, especially in neonates and infants.
•	 Management depends on the presence of signs of severity or complications or risk of
complications.
Clinical features
Neonates and infant
•	 Symptoms are not specific: fever, lethargy, irritability, poor oral intake, vomiting, loose stools
and jaundice. Palpation of the lower abdomen may show abdominal tenderness.
•	 The absence of fever does not rule out the diagnosis. On the other hand, fever with no
obvious cause– may be the only manifestation.
•	 Neonates may present with fever or hypothermia, altered general condition, altered
conscious state, pale/grey colour, shock etc.
•	 In practice, a urinary tract infection should be suspected in children with unexplained fever
or septic syndrome with no obvious focus of infection.
Older children
•	 Signs of cystitis (burning pain on urination and urinary urgency and frequency, etc.
•	 Fever > 38 °C
•	 Flank pain or abdominal tenderness
•	 Nausea and/or vomiting are common.
Laboratory: As for cystitis above Plus
•	 Full Blood count, where possible Urine culture, blood urea and creatinine levels
•	 Renal and bladder ultrasound where possible in:
o Children < 2 years of age with a first febrile UTI
o Children of any age with recurrent febrile UTIs
o Children of any age with a UTI who have a family history of renal or urologic disease,
poor growth, or hypertension
o Children who do not respond as expected to appropriate antimicrobial therapy
Treatment
Criteria for hospital admission:
•	 Patients at risk of complications: Neonates, infants and children with immunodeficiency
•	 Patients with complicated pyelonephritis: urinary tract obstruction, renal abscess,
•	 Patients with signs of severe infection: sepsis and septic shock, dehydration or vomiting
Neonates

--|Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)
Definition
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome characterised by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration
rate and retention of fluid and nitrogenous waste products.
AKI is classified as prerenal, renal and postrenal failure. In neonates exclude congenital
abnormality of the urinary tract
Clinical presentation
•	 Oliguria is the most common manifestation, i.e.:
o Neonates: output < 1 mL/kg/hour.
o Older children: output ≤ 0.3 mL/kg/hour.
•	 Prerenal: shock and dehydration.
•	 Postrenal: exclude obstruction, e.g. palpable bladder.
•	 Intrinsic kidney disease: oedema, volume overload, hypertension.
•	 Signs of underlying infection/septicaemia, e.g. fever, skin rash, etc.
67
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Investigations
•	 Full blood count
•	 Serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium and phosphate (Look for typical biochemistry
complications: hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis, hyponatraemia, hypocalcaemia,
hyperphosphataemia)
•	 Urine macroscopic appearance: brownish with acute tubular necrosis.
•	 Urine microscopy: red blood cell casts, leukocyte, hyaline and granular casts.
•	 Urine culture to exclude pyelonephritis.
•	 Ultrasound of kidneys and bladder.
Management
Non pharmacological
•	 Treat the underlying cause.
•	 Monitor fluid intake and output, blood pressure.
•	 Weigh daily.
•	 Nutritional support: High-energy diet. Give supplementary nasogastric feeds, if required.
•	 Restrict salt, potassium and phosphate intake.
•	 Avoid nephrotoxic or renally excreted medicines, e.g. NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, vancomycin,
cough and cold mixtures, radiocontrast drugs.
•	 Fluid management:
o Depends on volume status, urine output and extra-renal losses.
o Never use a potassium-containing solution in an anuric patient.
o Only use parenteral fluids if oral intake is not possible
o Fluid balance is critical. Assess at least every 12 hours to make appropriate changes to
fluid prescription.
o Fluid management is done according to fluid status
•	 Insensible water loss is calculated as:
o Neonates and young babies: 30 - 40 mL/kg/day
o Older children: 25 mL/kg/day (400 mL/m2/day)
•	 Pulmonary oedema plus oliguria/anuria: Do not give fluid.
•	 Hydrated anuric patient without extra-renal fluid losses: Oral fluid to replace insensible
water losses only.
•	 Normally hydrated plus oliguria: Oral fluid intake to replace insensible water loss plus urine
output of previous 24 hours.
•	 Dehydrated, oliguric and ongoing extra-renal fluid losses:
•	 Replace fluid losses with an appropriate solution which mirrors losses e.g.:
o For diarrhoea: ½ Darrows/dextrose 5%, IV or oral rehydration solution;
o For vomiting/gastric fluid losses: sodium chloride 0.9%/dextrose 5%.
•	 Normally hydrated plus normal urine output: Give normal fluid intake.
•	 Polyuria, (urine output > 4 mL/kg/hour): which usually occurs during the recovery (diuretic)
phase of acute tubular necrosis: Replace fluid and electrolyte losses with ½ Darrows/
dextrose 5%, IV. Volume to replace is equal to urine output of preceding 12 hours.
Management of Hyperkalaemia
•	 Monitor ECG for signs of hyperkalaemia.
•	 Discontinue all sources of intake of potassium.
•	 Treat when serum potassium ≥6.5 mmol/L.
•	 Monitor response to treatment and adjust accordingly.
o Calcium gluconate 10 %, IV, 0.5mL/kg/dose slowly over 3–5 minutes.
o Salbutamol, solution, 2.5–5 mg/dose, nebulise over 20 minutes. OR
•	 Sodium bicarbonate 4.2%, IV, 4 mL/kg administered over 4 hours.
o Do not mix calcium and sodium bicarbonate-containing solutions.
68
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Check Potassium level, if still no improvement
•	 Dextrose 10%, IV, 5 mL/kg over 20 minutes with/without insulin, soluble, 0.1units/kg
depending on the blood glucose level.
o If insulin is used -monitor for hypoglycaemia hourly.
•	 Sodium polystyrene sulphonate (Kayexelate), oral/rectal, 1 g/kg in dextrose water.
•	 If hyperkalaemia persists despite above treatment refer the patient urgently for dialysis.
Other complications
Metabolic acidosis: serum pH ≤ 7.1
•	 Sodium bicarbonate 4.2 %, IV, 4 mL/kg administered over 2–4 hours.
Infection
•	 Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics.
Pulmonary oedema, volume overload and hypertension
•	 Do not give fluid to anuric patients with pulmonary oedema.
•	 Intubate and initiate positive pressure ventilation as necessary.
•	 Furosemide, IV, 2–5 mg/kg administered over 5 minutes. Maximum daily dose: 8 mg/
kg/24 hours.
•	 Morphine, IV, 0.1 mg/kg. Repeat after 4 hours, if required.
•	 Oxygen, 100%, 2–3 L/minute by nasal cannula.
Note: Pulmonary oedema is an indication for dialysis in non-responsive cases.
Referral
•	 All children with AKI should be referred to a tertially hospital

--|Acne
Definition
Acne is a skin disease characterized by pimples on the face, chest, and back. It occurs when the
pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin cells and bacteria, caused by changes in
skin structures consisting of a hair follicle and its associated sebaceous gland. It can present in
inflammatory or non-inflammatory forms.
Acne is most common during adolescence but may continue into adulthood. For most people,
acne improves over time and tends to disappear in the early twenties. The most common sites
for acne vulgaris are the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin; the chest and back may sometimes
be involved.
75
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Causes and aggravating factors
•	 Sebum overproduction during puberty
•	 Altered hormonal status in adolescence with increased androgens in males
•	 Increased androgenic properties of progesterone in premenstrual females or those taking
progesterone-containing contraceptives
•	 Some medicines (e.g., steroids) and cosmetics
•	 Family history
•	 Infection by Propionibacterium, mainly P. acnes
Signs and symptoms
Acne can be categorised as mild, moderate, and severe.
Mild
•	 Open and closed comedones (i.e. whiteheads and blackheads)
•	 Some papules and pustules (pimples), commonly on face, chest, back and shoulders
Moderate
•	 More frequent papules and pustules
•	 Mild scarring
Severe
•	 All of the above plus nodular abscesses
•	 Leads to more extensive scarring that may be keloidal in some cases
Management objectives
•	 Alleviate symptoms by reducing the number and severity of lesion
•	 Limit duration and recurrence
•	 Decrease sebaceous gland activity
•	 Decrease bacterial infection and inflammation
•	 Minimise cosmetic disfigurement and psychological suffering
Nonpharmacological management
Advise patients to:
•	 Avoid squeezing pimples because doing so may increase the risk of scarring
•	 Avoid excessive use of cosmetics and use only water-based products
•	 Wash face with mild soap and water 3 times/day; minimise scrubbing
•	 Get some sun (sunshine is helpful), but avoid sunburn
•	 Shave as lightly and as infrequently as possible.
76
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Pharmacological management
For mild acne:
•	 Start with topical benzoyl peroxide cream or lotion 5%, once daily (use overnight).
•	 Treatment should be assessed after 4 weeks and, if beneficial, should be continued for at
least 4–6 months.
•	 If no satisfactory response with benzoyl peroxide, use topical antibiotics or a combined
preparation:
o Erythromycin lotion or solution 1.5% or 2% applied twice daily to the affected area OR
o Benzoyl peroxide 5%/erythromycin 3% gel applied twice daily to the affected area.
For moderate acne:
•	 Use topical treatment as for mild acne.
•	 If poor response to topical treatment, give oral antibiotics for at least 3 months:
o Erythromycin 250 mg twice a day for 4 weeks OR
o Doxycycline 100 mg once daily; can be taken with food or milk
Severe acne
•	 Use the topical treatment as for mild acne.
•	 Give also
o Tetracycline 250-1,000 mg/day
o Erythromycin 250–1,000 mg/day
•	 Duration of treatment depends on response. It may require 6 months to a year.
•	 Topical retinoid, e.g. Tretinoin cream/gel 0.05%, topical, applied sparingly once daily at
bedtime until substantial improvement. Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.
Referral
•	 All mild and moderate acne with poor response after 3 months of treatment
•	 All severe cases of acne
•	 Psychologically disturbed or depressed patient.
•	 Young females with premenstrual flare or with clinical signs of hyperandrogenism for
consideration of oral contraceptives.

--|Viral infections
 Varicella Zoster Virus (Chicken pox, VZV)
Definition
An acute, highly contagious, viral disease caused by herpes varicella-zoster.
It spreads by infective droplets or fluid from vesicles. One attack confers permanent immunity.
Varicella is contagious from about 2 days before the onset of the rash until all lesions crusted.
Re-activation of the virus may appear later as herpes zoster or shingles (in children, consider
immunosuppression if this occurs). Incubation period is 2–3 weeks.
79
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Complications are more common in immunocompromised patients and include:
•	 Secondary skin infection,
•	 Pneumonia,
•	 Necrotizing fasciitis,
•	 Encephalitis,
•	 Haemorrhagic varicella lesions with evidence of disseminated, intravascular coagulation.
•	 Two important bacteria causing complications are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
pyogenes
Diagnostic criteria
Clinical
•	 Mild headache, fever and malaise.
•	 Characteristic rash.
•	 The lesions progress from macules to vesicles in 24–48 hours.
•	 Successive crops appear every few days.
•	 The vesicles, each on an erythematous base, are superficial, tense ‘teardrops’ filled with
clear fluid that dries to form fine crusts.
•	 The rash is more profuse on the trunk and sparse at the periphery of extremities.
•	 At the height of eruption, all stages (macules, papules, vesicles and crusts) are present at
the same time.
•	 The rash lasts 8–10 days and heals without scarring, unless secondarily infected.
•	 Mucous membranes may be involved.
•	 Pruritus may be severe.
•	 Patients are contagious from 1–2 days before onset of the rash until crusting of lesions
Management
•	 Isolate the patient.
•	 Maintain adequate hydration.
Medications
•	 Antiviral therapy
•	 Indicated for immunocompetent patients with complicated varicella and for all
immunocompromised patients.
•	 Initiate as early as possible, preferably within 24 hours of the appearance of the rash.
•	 Neonates, immunocompromised patients and all cases with severe chickenpox (not
encephalitis)
•	 Acyclovir, oral, 20 mg/kg/dose 6 hourly for 7 days. Maximum dose: 800 mg/dose.

 Scabies
Definition
Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by a tiny mite (Sarcoptes scabei). It burrows into the
outer layer of the skin and deposits its eggs there. It spreads easily through person-to-person
contact. It is particularly problematic in areas of poor sanitation and overcrowding.
Signs and symptoms
•	 Nocturnal intense pruritus
•	 Lesion distribution:
•	 Interdigital web spaces.
•	 Around the nipples.
•	 Genital region.
•	 Lesion characteristics:
o Papules, pustules or excoriations.
o The pathognomonic sign: intradermal tunnel called scabietic “burrow”
Diagnosis
•	 Based on clinical history and physical examination.
o The history particularly itching of recent onset, and careful scrutiny of hands and wrists
will usually establish the diagnosis.
Investigation:
•	 Microscopic identification of skin scrapings
Complications:
•	 Secondary skin infection
•	 Sepsis
81
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Management objectives
•	 Prevent re-infection or further spread of the disease
•	 Relieve the itching
Non pharmacological management
•	 All close family and skin-to-skin contacts must be treated at the same time to prevent reinfection, even if symptoms are not evident.
•	 The patient should be advised to wash, boil, dry in the sun, and iron all clothing, bedding,
and bed linens after each use.
•	 The mattress, pillows, and chair cushions must be placed in the sun for at least 3 consecutive
days.
•	 Advise the patient to keep his or her nails short and clean.
•	 Instruct the patient to dry his or her skin thoroughly after bathing and to put on clean clothes.
•	 The whole house should be cleaned and disinfected with a disinfectant spray.
Pharmacological management
•	 Use benzyl benzoate lotion 25%.
o Adults and children >6 years: full strength 25% solution
o Children <6 years: 12% solution (dilute 25% solution 1 part solution: 1 part water
o Infants: 1:3 dilution
o Apply benzyl benzoate lotion to the entire body, excluding the face and nipple area of
breastfeeding women, for 3 consecutive evenings.
o Leave on overnight and wash off the next day.
o Attention should be paid to the toes, fingers, genital area and areas where the rash is
seen.
o A scrub bath must be taken before and after the 3 days of application.
o Repeat the treatment after 10 days.
•	 Itching may persist for some weeks after completing the treatment. This can be relieved by
taking Chlorpheniramine
o Give Chlorpheniramine (4 mg tablets; 2 mg/5 ml syrup) PO every 4–6 hours daily.
- Adults: One 4 mg tablet 4–6 times/day, not to exceed 24 mg/day
- Children
	2–5 years: 1 mg (. teaspoon) syrup 4–6 times/day, not to exceed 6 mg/
day
	6–12 years: 2 mg (. tablet or 5 mL—1 teaspoon—syrup) 4–6 times/ day,
not to exceed 12 mg/day
•	 Note: Itching usually starts to abate after 1 week and the rash after 3 weeks.
Referral
•	 If there are signs of treatment resistance, refer the patient to the specialist.

 INFECTIOUS DISEASES
--|Malaria
Definition
Malaria is a febrile haematozoid parasitic illness due to Plasmodium parasites. It may be
simple or severe form. In Rwanda, the main species is Falciparum (98% and the cause of severe
malaria cases. In Rwanda, there 3 forms of malaria:
Simple Malaria
•	 Axillary temperature 37.5 °C or history of fever in the last 24 hours with or without the
following signs: headache, weakness, chills, loss of appetite, stiffness, and muscular pains
•	 Laboratory confirmation using either a blood smear or a rapid test is compulsory in all cases
without exception.
Simple malaria with minor digestive symptoms
•	 Characterized by signs of simple malaria with vomiting that prevents oral medication with
or without associated moderate diarrhoea.
•	 The confirmation of Plasmodium by either blood smear or rapid test is compulsory without
any exception.
Severe malaria
•	 All severe malaria cases must be admitted to hospital.
•	 It is characterized by positive parasitaemia due to Plasmodium falciparum, accompanied
by one or more of the following signs of severity or danger in the absence of an identified
alternative cause:
o Inability to drink or suckle;
o Prostration; Generalized weakness with inability to sit, stand or walk without support
o Vomiting every feed
o Convulsions (≥ 2 convulsions in 24 hours);
o Lethargy and unconsciousness.
o Respiratory distress syndrome/Pulmonary oedema
o Metabolic acidosis
o Hypoglycaemia <2.2Mmol/L or < 40mg/dl
o Renal impairment
o Significant bleeding from any site
o Signs of shock
o Hyperparasitaemia of Falciparum> 10%
•	 Severe malaria is a medical emergency. Delay in diagnosis and inappropriate treatment,
leads to rapid worsening of the situation.
•	 The keys to effective management are early recognition, assessment and appropriate
antimalarial and supportive therapy.
Management of different forms of malaria
Management of simple malaria; First line treatment:
•	 Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT): Artemether 20 mg and Lumefantrine 120 mg
(COARTEM®), taken preferably during meals twice a day for 3 days

Important instructions to follow:
•	 Respect the dose prescribed by the health provider;
•	 Artemether-lumefantrine is contraindicated in:
o Children weighing less than 5 kg
o During first trimester pregnancy
o In cases of allergy to one of the two drugs in the combination
o In severe liver or renal disease
•	 In such cases, oral quinine sulphate is indicated, 10 mg per kg body 3 times for 7 days;
•	 If there is no improvement after 48 hours of treatment Artemether-Lumefantrine, verify if
the patient swallowed the drugs correctly, re-examine the patient carefully and do another
peripheral blood smear, and if the test is positive, change the treatment to oral quinine
sulphate at 10 mg per kg body weight per dose, taken three times a day over seven
consecutive days.
•	 If the peripheral blood smear is negative, exclude and treat other causes of illness and/or
refer the patient to the specialist
•	 If there is no improvement after 48 hours of treatment with quinine probably due to
associated pathologies other than malaria, refer the patient to the specialist
Recommendation:
Monotherapy using artemisinine derivatives is not allowed for the management of simple malaria in
Rwanda.
Management of simple malaria with minor digestive symptom:
Artesunate IV: 2.4 mg/kg body weight as a single dose on admission (time= 0) then at 12 hour, then
daily thereafter.
•	 If the patient’s condition improves, change to oral Artemether-lumefantrine twice a day for
three consecutive days.
•	 If the patient’s condition does not improve within 24 hours of treatment, refer the patient to
the specialist
Note: Preparation: Artesunate will be diluted in 1 ml 5% sodium bicarbonate (provided in the package),
and then further diluted with 5% dextrose or 0.9% normal saline to a total volume of 6 ml, giving a
final concentration of 10 mg/ml.
In case of contra indications of Arthemether derivatives give;
•	 Quinine dihydrochloride (Salt) intra-rectal: 15mg/kg body weight diluted in 4 ml of distilled
water or physiological saline and administered rectally with a 5 ml syringe every eight
hours. The drug is administered slowly through the anus, and the buttocks are held together
84

TREATMENT GUIDELINES
for 5 minutes to prevent a premature reflex ejection of the drug.
•	 If the patient’s condition improves, change to oral COARTEMR, 2 times a day for 3 consecutive
days, or in the case of contraindications to COARTEMR, administer oral quinine
•	 If no improvement after 24 hours of treatment, refer to the hospital
Recommendation:
•	 If the drug is ejected during the first 10 minutes following its administration, administer
another half dose;
•	 Diarrhoea and anal lesions contraindicates utilisation of intra-rectal route, then give Quinine
dihydrochloride (salt) intravenous: 10 mg /kg body weight per dose, diluted in 5 to 10 ml
of 5% or 10% glucose, every 8 hours.
•	 Rapid administration of Quinine is unsafe.
•	 If the patient’s condition does not improve within 24 hours of treatment, refer the patient to
hospital
•	 Quinine IM is contraindicated
Supportive treatment:
In case of diarrhoea and/or vomiting;
•	 Evaluate and monitor the hydration status of the patient
•	 Rehydrate the child with ORS or other available liquids, encourage breast feeding and
other modes of feeding and if necessary use a nasogastric tube
•	 Anti-emetics should be avoided as necessary
•	 In case of fever, give oral Paracetamol 15 mg/ kg per dose
Management of severe malaria;
Recommendations:
•	 Treatment must be initiated based on malaria positive blood smear or rapid diagnostic test
results
•	 Meanwhile, other investigations to determine severity and prognosis should be undertaken
•	 The management of severe malaria must be done in either district hospital or referral
hospital (private or public).
Pre-transfer treatment at the health centre:
•	 It is indicated to administer antimalarial treatment only after obtaining a positive blood
smear or positive rapid diagnostic test
•	 While preparing for the transfer of the patient, urgently administer IV Artusinate or quinine
intrarectally IR or IV (IV infusion) if there is a contraindication to artemesinine derivates and
depending on the general condition of the patient (weak pulse or not, dehydration or none),
the health centre staff will administer, either:
o Artesunate3.2 mg /kg IV as a single dose before transferring the patient OR
o Quinine by intrarectal route in children, 20mg per kg body weight diluted in 4ml of
distilled water of physiological saline, administered with a 5 ml syringe without a needle
OR
o Give quinine IV, preferably by intravenous infusion as a loading dose of 20 mg /kg
body weight to run in 4 hours (not exceeding a total dose of 1200 mg for the loading
dose);
Recommendation:
•	 Give parenteral antimalarial in the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24h,
once started (irrespective of the patient’s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier), and,
thereafter, complete treatment by giving a complete course of artemether plus lumefantrine
orally.
85
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 For cerebral malaria, administer the first dose of antibiotics; Ampicillin 50 mg/kg body
weight per dose, four times a day accompanied by - chloramphenicol 25 mg/ kg body
weight per dose, four times a day.
•	 In case of hypovolaemia (severe anaemia, rapid breathing, coma or systolic BP < 80 mm
Hg), start with normal saline or Ringer’s lactate infusion in a dose of 20 ml/kg to run for 15
minutes to move the patient out of shock.
•	 For malnourished children (kwashiorkor or marasmas), give the loading dose of quinine in IV
perfusion without fluid replenishment (to avoid the risk of circulatory overload).
•	 The administration of quinine intravenous infusion is preferable in severe cases (repeated
convulsions, coma. respiratory distress, shock)
•	 If an intravenous line is not possible, use intramuscular artemether or intrarectal quinine.
Note: The intramuscular use of Quinine is prohibited in all health facilities in Rwanda.
Supportive treatment:
•	 If the temperature is ≥38°C;
o Do tepid sponging
o Give Paracetamol 15 mg /kg body weight by oral route or suppository and injectable
forms
•	 To prevent hypoglycemia (characterized by lack of consciousness, severe weakness);
o Give 3-5ml/kg body weight of 10% glucose bolus or if not available 1 ml/kg of 50%
glucose diluted in 4ml of water for injection Or
o Administer water with 10% sugar per mouth or with nasogastric tube, at a rate of 5 ml/
kg (Preparation of 10% sugar/water: take 100 ml of boiled clean water and add 10
g of sugar or 2 coffee spoons
Treatment of the severe malaria in the hospital;
•	 Artesunate 2.4 mg/kg IV or IM given on admission (time = 0), then at 12h and 24h, then
once a day; Quinine is an acceptable alternative if parenteral Artusinate is not available
If Quinine is indicated:
•	 Loading dose of 20 mg/kg body weight of quinine dihydrochloride (do not exceed 1200
mg) diluted in an isotonic solution or 5 or 10% glucose on the basis of 5 to 10 ml/kg body
weight to run for 4 hours in IV perfusion.
•	 Then run IV glucose 5 or 10% for 4 hours as maintenance drip. Thereafter, a maintenance
dose of 10 mg/kg body weight of quinine dihydrochloride, to run for 4 hours repeated
every 8 hours until the patient can swallow, within 48 hours
•	 After 48 hours, if the patient’s state does not permit the patient to take quinine orally,
continue the drip of quinine by reducing the doses to 7 mg/kg every 8 hours to run for 4
hours.
•	 Give parenteral antimalarials in the treatment of severe malaria for a minimum of 24h,
once started (irrespective of the patient’s ability to tolerate oral medication earlier), and,
thereafter, complete treatment by giving a complete course of oral Artemether 20 mg and
Lumefantrine 120 mg, as recommended for the treatment of simple malaria
•	 Change to oral quinine 10 mg/kg of quinine sulphate every 8 hours as soon as the patient
can swallow; to complete the 7 days of treatment in case of contraindication in artemesinin
derivates
Recommendation:
•	 For the patient with weight ≥ 60kg give the loading dose, and decrease the dose from
1200mg to 800mg not to exceed 2000mg per day,
86
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022

Maintain airway, place patient on his or her side, exclude other treatable
causes of coma (e.g. hypoglycaemia, bacterial meningitis); avoid harmful
ancillary treatments, intubate if necessary.
Hyperpyrexia Administer tepid sponging, fanning, a cooling blanket and Paracetamol.
Convulsions
Maintain airways; treat promptly with intravenous or rectal diazepam
0.5 mg/kg body weight Intra-rectal; If convulsions persist, give
Phenobarbital 10-15 mg/kg IVI/IM; Check blood glucose.
Hypoglycaemia
Check blood glucose, correct hypoglycaemia and maintain with glucosecontaining infusion. Although hypoglycaemia is defined as glucose < 2.2
mmol/L, the threshold for intervention is < 3 mmol/L for children < 5
years and < 2.2 mmol/L for older children and adults.

Meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges usually due to infection
Causes
•	 Bacteria (H.influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, meningococcus…)
•	 Viruses (Herpes group…)
•	 Fungi (Cryptococcus Neoformans)
•	 Protozoa (toxoplasma gondii…)
 Note:
•	 Hemophilus Influenza and Streptococci are common causes in infants while Neisseria
meningitides is responsible for epidemics in older children …)
•	 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Fungal and protozoa infections are more common in
immunocompromised children like in HIV/AIDS and malnutrition
Signs and symptoms
In younger infants
•	 Nonspecific features e.g. vomiting, restlessness, irritability and poor feeding
•	 Convulsions and bulging fontanel are more reliable signs in this age group

TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Diagnosis
•	 Based on symptoms and signs
Investigations
•	 Lumber puncture and laboratory analysis of cerebral spinal fluid
•	 FBC, serum glucose, electrolytes (Na and K)
•	 Blood culture
Interpretation of the CSF results:

•	 Looks cloudy in bottle (turbid) and not a blood stained tap, and /or laboratory examination
with one or more of:
o White cell count more than 10x106/l
o Gram positive diplococci or gram negative coco bacilli
	If one is positive: definitive meningitis
	If all lab negative but one of the following (coma, stiff neck, bulging fontanel and
LP looks clear : probable meningitis
	If all of the clinical signs mentioned above, and CSF not done: possible meningitis
Complications:
•	 Convulsions
•	 Brain oedema

--|Hepatitis
Definition
It is an acute inflammation of the liver with varying degrees of hepatocellular necrosis. The most
commonly known are hepatitis A, B and less commonly C, D and E viruses. Hepatitis A
Cause:
•	 Hepatitis A RNA (virus)
•	 Vaccination does exist but provided in developed countries
•	 HAV is spread via the faecal-oral route
Symptoms and signs:
•	 Abrupt onset with nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, malaise, anorexia, vomiting, nausea,
abdominal pain or discomfort, and diarrhoea.
•	 Jaundice occurs one week after onset of symptoms, along with choluria (bilirubin in the urine)
and mild hepatomegaly.
•	 Young children are asymptomatic; Symptomatic 30 percent of infected children younger
than six years, jaundice usually lasts for less than two weeks. Conjugated bilirubin and
aminotransferases return to normal within two to three months
•	 In contrast, older children and adults with HAV infection are usually symptomatic for several
weeks. Approximately 70 percent are jaundiced, and 80 percent have hepatomegaly.
Symptoms last for a longer time
•	 The most common extrahepatic manifestations include an evanescent rash (11 percent) and
arthralgias (14 percent). and less common extrahepatic manifestations include vasculitis,
arthritis, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, encephalitis, and bone marrow suppression
Complications:
•	 Acute liver failure is rare in developed countries , but account for 60% of liver failure in
Latin America
•	 Death
Diagnosis: Made based on clinical symptoms and signs
Investigations
•	 Liver Function tests
•	 Anti-HAV IgM in a patient with the typical clinical presentation
•	 Serological tests for Hepatitis A
Management:
•	 improved sanitary conditions, adherence to sanitary practices, hand washing +++ (virus
may survive for up to four hours on the fingertips )
•	 No specific treatment for Hepatitis A
•	 Bed rest may be recommended but does not alter the course of the illness
•	 Human immunoglobulin prophylaxis for those who had contact
•	 Isolate patient of Hepatitis A for 7–10 after the onset of jaundice
Patients rarely require hospitalization except for those who develop fulminant hepatic failure.
92
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
 Hepatitis B
Cause:
•	 Hepatitis B DNA virus (HBV)
•	 Perinatal transmission is the most common cause of chronic infection
•	 Infants born to women with HBV infection (HBeAg positive or negative) should be tested for
hepatitis B at 9-18 months even if vaccinated ( at least 5% develop chronic HBV)
•	 All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection
Symptoms and signs:
Infection with HBV is associated with characteristic changes in the serum levels of hepatitis B
antigens and antibodies. These markers are used to define different clinical states
Acute hepatitis
•	 Acute HBV infection in children ranges from asymptomatic infection to fulminant hepatitis.
•	 Constitutional symptoms, anorexia, nausea, jaundice and right-upper-quadrant discomfort.
•	 The symptoms and jaundice generally disappear after one to three months, but some
patients have prolonged fatigue even after normalization of serum aminotransferase
concentrations. Older children and adolescents have mild constitutional symptoms during
acute HBV infection.
 Chronic hepatitis
•	 Commonly asymptomatic and grow and develop normally.
•	 Vague right upper quadrant discomfort and fatigue, loss of appetite, jaundice.
•	 Extrahepatic manifestations including polyarteritis nodosa and glomerulonephropathy.
Diagnosis:
•	 Based on persistence of HBsAg for more than six months; IgG anti-HBc is positive, while IgM
anti-HBc is negative
•	 Some carriers have large numbers of HBV in their serum and liver without symptoms or signs
and without antibodies in their serum.
Investigations
Table 28. Serologic responses to HBV infection
•	 Left panel: Acute infection:
o HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen), HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), and HBV DNA
beginning in the preclinical phase.
93
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
o IgM anti-HBc (hepatitis B core antigen) appears early in the clinical phase; the
combination of this antibody and HBs Ag makes the diagnosis of acute infection.
o Recovery: normalization of the serum ALT, the disappearance of HBV DNA, HBeAg to
anti-HBe seroconversion, and subsequently HBsAg to anti-HBs seroconversion and switch
from IgM to IgG anti-HBc. Then previous HBV infection is characterized by anti-HBs and
IgG anti-HBc.
•	 Right panel: Chronic infection:
o Persistence of HBsAg for more than six months after acute infection
o Persistence of HBeAg (for a variable period), HBsAg, and HBV DNA in the circulation
o Anti-HBs is not seen.
•	 Other tests
o Liver Function tests (Prothrombin time, Bleeding time)
o Glycemia if severe
o HBV tests (refer to figure )
o Blood ammonia
o Urea and electrolytes in cases of liver failure
o CBC to determine severity of anaemia
Complications:
•	 Chronic Liver Disease: In children born from infected mother 76 percent of them are HBeAg
positive at 10 years of age. The frequency of spontaneous seroconversion increases during
puberty (Cirrhosis)
•	 Liver failure (hepatic encephalopathy)
•	 Portal hypertension (GIT bleeding, hematemesis and melena stools)
•	 Hepatorenal syndrome /reduced glomerular filtration rate.
•	 Liver cancer
Management:
General measures:
•	 Counseling of the patient about alcohol use in adolescents and family, surveillance for
disease progression and development of complications,
•	 Regular monitoring of liver function tests every 3 months
•	 Patients who are in the inactive carrier phase of hepatitis B infection (ie, HBsAg positive,
HBeAg negative, anti HBe positive, persistently normal ALT/AST levels, serum HBV DNA
<10(5) copies/mL) should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests every 6 to 12
months.
94
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Selection of patients for treatment:
•	 Treatment is generally considered in patients with HBV DNA positive chronic hepatitis who
are in the immune active phase (usually defined as ALT >2 x ULN and HBV DNA >20,000
IU/mL or 10(5) copies/mL, for at least six months)
•	 Children with ALT values greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal but with concomitant
low HBV DNA levels may be in the process of spontaneous seroconversion, and may not
require treatment. These patients should be observed for several months with serial serologic
testing.
•	 If there is evidence of hepatic decompensating, such as jaundice or coagulopathy, treatment
should be initiated earlier
•	 Several other considerations may be relevant to treatment decisions ( co-infected with HCV,
HIV or HDV)
Choice of treatment:
•	 Lamivudine, TDF and interferon (IFN), are licensed for use in children Adefovir approved for
use in those over 12 years of age.
•	 IFN alfa as the first-line treatment for the patients with serum ALT more than twice the upper
limit of normal, have positive HBeAg, who are committed to adhering to the treatment, and
have no comorbid diseases that might be exacerbated by an immunostimulatory agent
•	 If the patient does not respond to IFN alfa (defined by detectable HBV DNA and elevated
serum ALT six months after completion of the course of IFN alfa), a nucleoside/nucleotide
analog such as lamivudine or adefovir can be used – this shall be considered as primary
treatment if IFN alpha not available
--|Acute liver failure
Definition

--|Septicaemia
Definition
Septicemia is a suspected or proven infection plus an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response
syndrome, SIRS (e.g., fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and leukocytosis).
Causes:
•	 Bacterial: (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitidis,
group A streptococcus, S. aureus, Salmonella)
•	 Viral infection: (influenza, enteroviruses, hemorrhagic fever group, HSV, RSV)
•	 Encephalitis: (arboviruses, enteroviruses, HSV)
•	 Vaccine reaction (pertussis, influenza, measles)
•	 Toxin-mediated reaction (toxic shock, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome)
Clinical evaluation:
•	 Assess Air way, Breathing ( RR, signs of respiratory distress and pulse oximetry),
•	 Circulation (HR, BP, Skin for signs of dehydration, JVP)
•	 SIRS a is systemic inflammatory response with at least two of the following four criteria, one
of which must be abnormal temperature or leucocyte count:
o Core temperature of < 36ºC or > 38.5ºC,
o Tachycardia,
o Tachypnoea,
o Increased WBC (>12,000/mm3) or decreased (<4000/mm3) PLUS, one of the following:
	Cardiovascular dysfunction,
	Acute respiratory distress syndrome, or
	 ≥ 2 other organ dysfunctions
•	 Identify source of infection e.g pneumonia, abdominal abscess, meningitis e.t.c
•	 Assess organ function e.g. CNS (LOC, focal signs) , Renal function for urinary output
Diagnosis: Based on signs and symptoms complemented by laboratory investigations
Clinical
On examination, look for the following:
•	 Fever with no obvious focus of infection
•	 Blood film for malaria is negative
•	 No stiff neck or other specific signs of meningitis (or a lumbar puncture for meningitis is
negative)
•	 Signs of systemic upset (e.g. inability to drink or breastfeed, convulsions, lethargy or vomiting
everything)
97
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Purpura may be present.
•	 Always fully undress the child and examine carefully for signs of local infection before
deciding that no cause can be found.
Laboratory evaluation
•	 Identify SIRS; CBC and White-cell differential
•	 Identify source of infection; Blood and urine culture and sensitivity, sputum, CSF analysis,
Chest radiography and Ultrasonography when indicated
•	 Assess organ function;
o Renal function: Electrolytes, BUN, creatinine
o Hepatic function: Bilirubin, AST, alkaline phosphatase
o Coagulation: INR, PTT, platelets
Complications:
•	 Convulsions
•	 Confusion or coma
•	 Dehydration
•	 Multiorgan failure
•	 Disseminated intravascular coagulation(with bleeding episodes)
•	 Pneumonia
•	 Septic shock; which is the main cause of death
Management:
•	 Assess for Air way, Breathing, Circulation, and Dehydration followed by appropriate
management.
•	 Treat the source of sepsis e.g abscess, peritonitis
•	 First choice treatment
o Neonates: Cefotaxime, IV, 75 mg/kg/dose, 8 hourly
o Children > 1 month: Ceftriaxone, IV, 50 mg/kg/dose, 12 hourly.
 Alternative:
o Give IV ampicillin at 50 mg/kg every 6 h plus IV gentamicin 7.5 mg/kg once a day for
7–10 days
•	 If staphylococcal infection is suspected use Cloxacillin, IV, 50 mg/kg/dose 6 hourly for at
least 14 days, (longer courses often required).
Monitoring
•	 The child should be checked by nurses at least every 3 hours and by a doctor at least twice
a day.
•	 Check for the presence of complications such as shock, reduced urine output, signs of
bleeding (petechiae, purpura, bleeding from venepuncture sites), or skin ulceration.
Recommendation:
•	 Immunization with the conjugate H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae vaccines is for all
infants
N.B Use of Corticosteroids in patients with sepsis has adverse effects like hyperglycemia and
immunosuppression thus leading to nosocomial infection and impaired wound healing. Studies reveal
that early use of short-course, high-dose corticosteroids does not improve survival in severe sepsis.

--|Acute Osteitis/Osteomyelitis
Definition
Osteitis is inflammation of the bone while osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone
Most cases result from haematogenous deposition of organisms in the bone marrow after a
transient bacteraemia episode. Osteomyelitis most commonly begins in the metaphyses of long
bones which are highly vascular. The spread of infection through the epiphysis can result in
septic arthritis.
Causes:
•	 Neonates: S. aureus, Group B Streptococci, Gram negative (E. coli).
•	 Infants/children: S. aureus, H. influenzae, Group A Streptococci, S. pneumoniae.
•	 Traumatic direct infection: P. aeruginosa (penetrating foot wounds).
•	 Co-existing medical conditions e.g. diabetes, HIV, leucopoenia: M. tuberculosis, fungi.
•	 Sickle cell disease: Salmonella, pneumococcus.
Diagnostic criteria
Clinical
•	 Local pain and tenderness, loss of function, general toxicity and fever.
•	 If lower extremities are involved (development of a limp or refusal to bear weight).
•	 In neonates, early signs may be subtle or non-specific, e.g. irritability, feeding problems and
pseudoparalysis.
•	 Investigate for multi-organ disease, e.g. endocarditis, pericarditis and pneumonia.

--|Salmonella infections (typhoid fever):
Definition: is a systemic infection with the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype typhi.
Causes and risk factors
•	 Salmonella typhi causes typhoid. The bacteria survives only in humans.
•	 More than 95% of all transmission occurs through food, especially eggs.
•	 Water contaminated by faeces from an infected person carries the disease.
•	 Symptoms are most severe in infants and those with other comorbidities
•	 Immune compromised patients are frequently affected and have recurrences.
Signs and symptoms
Initial signs and symptoms:
•	 Prolonged or high fever (≥38.8), with profuse sweating, in a previously healthy individual,
lasting>1 week; the person may become delirious and possible convulsions
•	 A slower pulse rate than expected with the level of fever
•	 Dull frontal headache
•	 Poorly localized abdominal pain, constipation, anorexia, nausea and diarrhoea later in the
illness; may be accompanied by frank bleeding
•	 A coated tongue, abdomen tenderness and hepatosplenomegaly are common findings
•	 Jaundice may occur
Signs of complications
•	 Intestinal perforation—abdominal tenderness, with sudden increase in pulse rate and
hypotension
•	 Altered mental status
NB: there is no typhoid fever without fever or hypothermia in infants !!!
Diagnosis:
On examination, key diagnostic features of typhoid are:
•	 Fever with no obvious focus of infection
•	 No stiff neck or other specific signs of meningitis, or a lumbar puncture for meningitis is
102
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
negative (note: children with typhoid can occasionally have a stiff neck
•	 Signs of systemic upset, e.g. inability to drink or breastfeed, convulsions, lethargy,
disorientation/confusion, or vomiting everything
•	 Rose spots on the abdominal wall in light-skinned children
•	 Hepatosplenomegaly, tense and distended abdomen.
Note:
•	 Typhoid fever can present atypically in young infants as an acute febrile illness with shock
and hypothermia.
•	 The differential diagnosis is broad and includes malaria, amoebiasis, dengue fever,
leishmaniasis, and other causes of bacterial gastroenteritis
Laboratory evaluation
•	 FBC (may show leukocytosis or leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, severe anaemia follows
intestinal bleeding)
•	 Blood culture( Gold standard) will isolate the bacteria during the first 2 weeks of illness
•	 Stool culture will isolate the bacteria during the later period of illness.
•	 Plain X-rays of abdomen in erect position will show gas under the diaphragm if there is
gut perforation
Note:
•	 Serologic tests such as the Widal test are of limited clinical utility in endemic areas because
positive results may represent previous infection. Positive serology alone shall never be a
base for treatment of typhoid fever
Complications:
•	 GIT: gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal perforation, abdominal mass due to abscess
formation
•	 CVS: Asymptomatic electrocardiographic changes, Myocarditis, Shock
•	 CNS: Encephalopathy, Delirium, Psychotic behaviour, Meningitis, Impairment of coordination
•	 Haematologic: Anaemia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation
•	 Respiratory: Bronchitis, Pneumonia (Salmonella enterica serotype typhi, Streptococcus
pneumoniae)
•	 Others: Focal abscess, Pharyngitis, Relapse and Chronic carriage
•	 Chronic carriers frequently have high serum antibody titers against the Vi antigen, which is
a clinically useful test for rapid identification of such patients
Management:
Management objectives:
•	 Reduce the fever
•	 Prevent dehydration
•	 Prevent the spread of the disease in the community
Nonpharmacological management
•	 Encourage adequate oral fluids or initiate IV infusion.
•	 Ensure appropriate nutrition.
•	 Tepid sponging with lukewarm water (32-35oC) to reduce the fever.
•	 Isolate the patient
•	 Identify and treat all carriers
Pharmacological
•	 Paracetamol to reduce fever
•	 Rectal Diazepam if there are convulsions
103
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 blood transfusion in case of severe bleeding
•	 Ciprofloxacin ivi 10mg/kg/dose (max400mg) 12 hourly or 15mg/kg (max500mg) orally
12 hourly for 7-10 days
•	 Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg 12 hourly IV for 7-14 days OR
•	 Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV 6 hourly for 7-14days
Follow up review: check for the following:
•	 Efficacy of treatment: fever

•	 Myocarditis (heart rate, gallop rhythm )
--|Varicella (chicken pox)
#? Transfer to Dermatology
Definition
An acute, highly contagious, viral disease caused by herpes varicella-zoster.
It spreads by infective droplets or fluid from vesicles. One attack confers permanent immunity.
Varicella is contagious from about 2 days before the onset of the rash until all lesions crusted.
Re-activation of the virus may appear later as herpes zoster or shingles (in children, consider
immunosuppression if this occurs). Incubation period is 2–3 weeks.
Complications are more common in immunocompromised patients and include:
•	 Secondary skin infection,
•	 Pneumonia,
•	 Necrotizing fasciitis,
•	 Encephalitis,
•	 Haemorrhagic varicella lesions with evidence of disseminated, intravascular coagulation.
•	 Two important bacteria causing complications are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus
pyogenes
Diagnostic criteria
Clinical
•	 Mild headache, fever and malaise.
•	 Characteristic rash.
•	 The lesions progress from macules to vesicles in 24–48 hours.
•	 Successive crops appear every few days.
•	 The vesicles, each on an erythematous base, are superficial, tense ‘teardrops’ filled with
clear fluid that dries to form fine crusts.
•	 The rash is more profuse on the trunk and sparse at the periphery of extremities.
•	 At the height of eruption, all stages (macules, papules, vesicles and crusts) are present at
the same time.
•	 The rash lasts 8–10 days and heals without scarring, unless secondarily infected.
•	 Mucous membranes may be involved.
•	 Pruritus may be severe.
•	 Patients are contagious from 1–2 days before onset of the rash until crusting of lesions
Management
•	 Isolate the patient.
•	 Maintain adequate hydration.

ENDOCRINE SYSTEM CONDITIONS
--|Diabetes mellitus
Definition
Diabetes mellitus is disorder of absolute or relative insulin deficiency that results in increased
blood glucose and disruption of energy storage and metabolism. Diabetes Mellitus is generally
divided into two classifications: Diabetes Mellitus I and Diabetes Mellitus Type II.
Diabetes Mellitus Type I: This results from the destruction of the pancreatic beta cells that leads to
absolute insulin deficiency. Type IA is secondary to the autoimmune destruction of the beta cells.
Type IB is secondary to non-autoimmune destruction of the beta cells. Type I diabetes accounts
for approximately 2/3 of the new diagnosis of diabetes in patients < 19 years old. There is a
component of genetic susceptibility and close relatives of patients with type I DM are at higher
risk of developing the disease.
Diabetes Mellitus Type II: This is secondary to varying degrees of insulin resistance and insulin
deficiency and is related to both genetic and environmental influences including predisposing
medications such as steroids and some ARVs. It is the most common type of diabetes mellitus
in adults.
Neonatal diabetes: This is defined as persistent hyperglycaemia occurring in the first months of
life that lasts more than 2 weeks and requires insulin therapy for management. The majority of
affected infants are small for gestational age and present with weight loss, volume depletions,
hyperglycaemia and glycosuria with or without ketonuria and ketoacidosis.
Signs and Symptoms
History of:
•	 Polyuria: This occurs when the serum glucose concentration rises above 180 mg/dl
exceeding the renal threshold for glucose and leads to increased urinary glucose excretion
and a subsequent osmotic diuresis. This may present as nocturia, bedwetting, or daytime
incontinence in a previously toilet trained child, or heavy diapers.
106
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Polydipsia: This is secondary to increased thirst from increased serum osmolality and
dehydration.
•	 Polyphagia: This is due to an increased appetite that occurs initially secondary to loss of
calories from glycosuria. This symptoms is not always present.
•	 Weight loss: This is due to hypovolemia and increased catabolism.
•	 Weakness/Lethargy with ultimate progression to coma: This is secondary to hypovolemia
and electrolyte disturbances including progressive acidosis.
•	 Visual disturbances: This is secondary to osmotic changes in the lens.
•	 Further history to exclude other co-existing autoimmune disease such as hypothyroidism,
vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, etc., and to further ask about family history of endocrinopathies
or autoimmune diseases
Physical examination:
•	 Full general and systemic examination
•	 Fundoscopy: to rule out diabetic retinopathy.
•	 Foot examination: for features of diabetic neuropathy and diabetic wounds
Diagnosis:
Clinical: The diagnosis should be suspected based on the signs and symptoms described above.
Any of the above signs or symptoms should prompt further investigations.
Investigations:
•	 Blood sugar: Diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus:
o Symptoms of DM plus random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) OR
o Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L). Fasting is defined as no oral intake
for at least 8 hours.
OR
o Two-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as
described by the WHO.
OR
o HgA1C > 6.5 percent. This laboratory should be performed in a certified laboratory
with an assay standardized to the diabetes control and complications trial (DCCT).
•	 Additional studies to evaluate severity and complications of the disease:
o Blood gas if concern for diabetic ketoacidosis (where) available.
o Electrolytes
o Renal function tests (urea and creatinine) to evaluate for diabetic nephropathy and
dehydration.
o Urine analysis to check for glycosuria, ketones, and protein
o HbA1c: This can be used for diagnosis (see below) or to assess severity of disease and
to assess response to therapy.
o Lipid profile
o Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): This should be performed in type 1 diabetics as
autoimmune diseases may occur together.
Complications:
Short-term complications:
•	 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Occurs more frequently in type I diabetes mellitus, but may
occur in some forms of type I diabetes mellitus.
•	 Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS): Occurs in type II diabetes mellitus.
•	 Insulin resistance secondary to hyperglycaemia: This occurs in both type I and type II diabetes
mellitus.
•	 Infections due to immunosuppression and commonly include oral candidiasis and urinary
tract infections.
107
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Death: Patients presenting with DKA or HHS have a high mortality rate.
Long Term complications:
•	 Vascular complications including both microangiopathy and macroangiopathy:
o Nephropathy
o Retinopathy
o Neuropathy
o Cardiovascular disease
o Hypertension
•	 Dyslipidaemia
•	 Growth retardation or obesity depending on the insulin therapy. Patients may also have
delayed puberty secondary to poor growth.
•	 Psychiatric disorders including depression related to their chronic disease.
Management:
General objectives:
•	 Maintain normal glycaemia with insulin therapy or oral medications (in type II diabetes
mellitus) to prevent both the signs and symptoms of uncontrolled hyperglycaemia and the
complications mentioned above.
Non pharmaceutical management
•	 Assess A-B-C-D (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability)
•	 If patient has signs or symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar
hyperglycaemic state, this is an emergency and treatment must be initiated immediately.
•	 The patient and the family should be counselled on the cause and the treatment of diabetes
and its management. The patient and the family should be taught how to monitor blood
glucose, record the test results, administer and adjust insulin doses based on blood glucose
values and food intake.
•	 They family should be counselled on the complications of diabetes mellitus and how to manage
them. In particular, they should know the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycaemia and its
management. They should also understand the importance of maintaining normoglycemia to
avoid long-term complications. They should be instructed on how to manage acute illnesses
in the context of diabetes mellitus, for example how to manage their insulin dose if they are
unable to tolerate oral intake.
•	 Diet modification is important in both type I and type II diabetes mellitus. A nutritionist
should be involved in providing individualized recommendations.
Pharmaceutical management
•	 The majority of children with diabetes mellitus have type I diabetes and may present with
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The management of DKA is detailed below.
•	 Diabetes Mellitus Type I: Children with Diabetes Mellitus Type I require insulin therapy. The
patient is insulin dependent and while the insulin therapy may be adjusted based on the
clinical condition and blood glucose results, the insulin therapy should NEVER be stopped
completely as this could result in the development of DKA and death.
--|Diabetic ketoacidosis
Definition
DKA is the increase in the serum concentration of ketones greater than 5 mEq/L, a blood
glucose level greater than 250 mg/dL and a blood pH less than 7.3.
Other features include: Ketonaemia, ketonuria and low serum bicarbonate level <18 mEq/L.
108
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Causes:
•	 Previously undiagnosed diabetes
•	 Interruption of insulin therapy
•	 Underlying infection and intercurrent illness
•	 Poor management of DM type 1
•	 Stress
•	 Medication like corticosteroids
Signs and Symptoms:
The signs and symptoms of DKA can develop suddenly and include:
•	 Polydipsia
•	 Polyuria
•	 Nausea and vomiting
•	 Abdominal pain
•	 Weakness or fatigue
•	 Rapid deep breathing
•	 Fruity-scented breath
•	 Confusion or drowsiness
•	 Hot, dry skin
•	 Blurred vision
Suspect DKA even if the blood glucose is normal in a child with known diabetes and any of the
following:
•	 Nausea or vomiting
•	 Abdominal pain
•	 Hyperventilation
•	 Dehydration
•	 Reduced level of consciousness
Investigations:
•	 Blood glucose
•	 Urine dipsticks for glucose and ketones
•	 Blood urea and electrolytes
•	 Malaria
•	 Full blood count
•	 Blood and urine cultures
Management:
DKA treatment goals
•	 Management of A,B, C
•	 Admission to HDU/ICU if possible for close monitoring
•	 Correct dehydration with intravenous fluids
•	 Correct hyperglycaemia with insulin and ivi fluids
•	 Correct acidosis and reverse ketosis
•	 Monitor for complications of DKA (cerebral oedema).
•	 Correct electrolyte imbalances, especially potassium loss
•	 Restore blood glucose to near normal.
•	 Identify and treat any precipitating event.
Fluid requirements
•	 Fluids for resuscitation in shock:
o Sodium chloride 0.9%, IV, 10–20 mL/kg over 10–30 minutes.
o Repeat if shock persists.
109
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Fluid requirements after resuscitation
o Fluid requirement = deficit + maintenance
o Calculate deficit = estimated % dehydration x body weight (e.g. 10kg with 5%
dehydration 10 x 50 = 500mL)
o Calculate maintenance (mL): use the Holliday–Segar formula (max wt.75kg :
	≤1 year: 120 mL/kg/24 hours
	All children older than 1 year; it is the sum of the following:
	First 10 kg body weight: 100 mL/kg/24 hours
	Second 10 kg body weight: 50 mL/kg/24 hours
	Additional weight > 20 kg body weight: 20 ml/kg/24 hour
•	 Add the deficit to 48 hour maintenance and replace this volume evenly over 48 hours,
initially with sodium chloride 0.9%.
Example 6 year old with 24kg
Deficit after resuscitation is 50 x 24 = 1200ml
Maintenance (100 x 10) + (10 x 50+ (4 x20) = 1580ml/24hour
Maintenance in 48 hours = 1580 x 2 = 3160ml
Deficit + maintenance = 3160+1200 = 4360
Rehydration will be 4360/48 = 91ml/hour
•	 When blood glucose falls to < 15 mmol/L change the infusion to a dextrose containing
maintenance fluid, e.g. dextrose 5% in sodium chloride 0.45%.
•	 Assess hydration status at least every 3 hours

Emergency Insulin Therapy:
•	 Delay insulin until serum K+ is > 3,5 mmol/l
•	 Insulin should only be started after 30-60 minutes of fluid therapy, provided shock has been
treated.
•	 Use regular Insulin short-acting (Actrapid or Humulin R), IV, 0.1 unit/kg, hourly
•	 If the rate of blood glucose fall exceeds 5 mmol/ L/hour or the blood glucose falls to 14
mmol/L:
o Add a dextrose-containing fluid.
o Do not stop the insulin while dextrose is being infused.
•	 If the blood glucose falls below 4 mmol/L:
o Give a bolus of 2 mL/kg of dextrose 10% and increase the concentration of dextrose
in the infusion.
•	 If glucose fall is inadequate, ie. a fall of < 4 mmol/l/hr - double the dose of insulin
•	 If glucose fall is excessive, ie a fall of > 5,5 mmol/l/hr - halve the dose of insulin
•	 Continue with IV insulin until:
o Base deficit is < 5 or bicarbonate is ≥15 mmol/L,
o There is no ketonuria,
o Blood glucose is ≤10 mmol/L.
110
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022

•	 If blood glucose stable and urine ketones negative, then start standard insulin regimen
Potassium (K+):
•	 If hyperkalaemia (serum K+ or ECG) withhold potassium supplementation
•	 If serum K+ is normal or low and patient is passing urine: Start K+ supplementation
immediately
•	 K+ replacement will be necessary in all cases (even with initial hyperkalaemia)

Changing from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin
•	 When oral fluids are tolerated, reduce intravenous fluids.
•	 Subcutaneous insulin can be started once the child is well hydrated and able to tolerate a
normal diet
Transitional insulin therapy (Sliding Scale):
Monitor Blood Glucose 4−hourly and give the corresponding amount of Soluble/Regular insulin
subcutaneously
Blood Glucose Result Amount of Soluble/Regular Insulin to be given
Less than 6 mmol/L No Insulin
6.1 − 9.0 mmol/L 0.06 units/kg body weight
9.1 − 12.0 mmol/L 0.09 units/kg body weight
12.1−15.0 mmol/L 0.12 units/kg body weight
15.1−18.0 mmol/L 0.15 units/kg body weight
Sliding scale is considered when the patient is;
•	 Out of coma and no acidosis
•	 Continue the sliding scale, making appropriate adjustments to the doses of insulin, until
the patient is eating normally and the urine is free of ketones. This may take on average
between 12 − 24 hours.
Maintenance insulin therapy:
•	 Determine dose on normal requirement: 1 units/kg/day
•	 2 Injections regimen:
o Administer subcutaneously in the form of 50% intermediate acting insulin (NPH or Lente)
and 50% rapid insulin. Total dose divided in 2 doses:
	2/3 before breakfast (1/2 rapid insulin and 1/2 intermediate acting insulin)
	Remaining 1/3 before the evening meal ( 1/2 Rapid insulin and 1/2 intermediate
acting insulin)

OR
•	 4 Injections regimen (Prandial regimen):Total dose divided in 4 doses:
o 50% of intermediate acting insulin at bed time
o 50% of rapid acting insulin dived in 3 doses – 20% before breakfast, 10% before
lunch and 20% before dinner
Treatment of intercurrent infection:
•	 Start empiric antibiotics on suspicion of infection until culture results are available: Cefotaxime
100mg/kg/day/7days
Recommendation:
•	 Regular follow-up of all diabetics is important to assess their blood sugar control
•	 Dietary education
•	 Physical activity

Nocturnal hypoglycaemia
Nightmares and headaches may be suggestive of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.
112
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Blood glucose concentrations fall to their lowest levels between 02h00 and 04h00.
Grading of severity:
Mild (Grade 1)
•	 Child or adolescent is aware of, responds to and self-treats the hypoglycaemia.
•	 Children < 6 years of age can rarely be classified as grade 1 because they are unable to
help themselves.
Moderate (Grade 2)
•	 Child or adolescent cannot respond to hypoglycaemia and requires help from someone
else, but oral treatment is successful.
Severe (Grade 3)
•	 Child or adolescent is semiconscious or unconscious with or without convulsions and may
require parenteral therapy with glucagon or intravenous glucose.
Diagnosis: is made on clinical signs and investigations
Investigations:
•	 Blood glucose
Management:
Outside the hospital
Mild or moderate hypoglycaemia:
•	 Glucose, oral, 5–15 g or 1-3 level teaspoons of sugar (depending on child’s age) in a small
amount of water.
•	 Wait 10–15 minutes.
•	 If blood glucose has not risen to 6-8 mmol/L, repeat above.
•	 As symptoms improve, the next meal or oral complex carbohydrate should be taken, e.g.
fruit, bread, cereal, milk, etc.
Severe hypoglycaemia
•	 Glucagon, IM/SC, 0.1–0.2 mg/10 kg body weight.
o If < 12 years of age: 0.5 mg.
o If > 12 years of age: 1.0 mg.
•	 If glucagon is not available:
o A teaspoon of sugar moistened with water placed under the tongue, every 20 minutes
until patient awakes
In hospital
•	 10% Glucose, IV, 2−4 ml/kg 1 to 3 minutes followed by 5−10% Glucose, IV, according to
total daily fluid requirement until the patient is able to eat normally (Dextrose 50% 1 mL +
water for injection 4 mL = 5 mL 10% dextrose solution).
•	 If IV dextrose cannot be given; give glucagon, IM/SC, 0.1–0.2 mg/10 kg body wt
o If < 12 years of age: 0.5 mg.
o If > 12 years of age: 1.0 mg.
Recommendation
•	 Monitor blood glucose every 15-30 minutes until stable, then repeat 1–2 hourly.
•	 Keep blood glucose between 6 and 8 mmol/L
Referral
•	 Recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
113
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
--|Guidelines for management of diabetics on sick days
Definition
Illness associated with fever tends to raise blood glucose because of higher levels of stress
hormones, gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance.
Illness associated with vomiting and/or diarrhoea may lower blood glucose, with the possibility
of hypoglycaemia and the development of starvation ketones.
Diagnostic criteria
•	 Unstable blood glucose measurements as a result of illness, stress or starvation.
•	 Increased insulin requirements are induced by a catabolic state and stress.
•	 Ketonuria may also indicate the following:
o In the presence of hyperglycaemia, it is indicative of severe insulin deficiency and calls
for urgent therapy to prevent progression into ketoacidosis;
o In the presence of low blood glucose levels, it is indicative of a starvation state or is the
result of a counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia.
General and supportive measures
•	 Monitor glucose more frequently.
•	 Test urine for ketones.
•	 Ensure adequate intake of calories and fluids on sick days to prevent ketogenesis. If
insufficient calories are consumed, ketones will appear in the urine without hyperglycaemia.
In this circumstance encourage the patient to eat whatever he/she feels like.
•	 Treat underlying intercurrent illness.
Special circumstances:
Gastroenteritis:
•	 If hypoglycaemia occurs especially with gastroenteritis, and there is mild ketonuria, ensure
that the child takes regular frequent amounts of carbohydrate, using oral rehydration
solution or intravenous fluids.
Loss of appetite:
•	 Replace meals with easily digestible food and sugar-containing fluids.
Vomiting:
•	 If the patient has difficulty eating or keeping food down and the blood glucose is < 10
mmol/L, encourage the patient to take sugar containing liquids. Give small volumes. Some
glucose will be absorbed. If there is no vomiting, increase the amount of liquid.
Medications
Insulin therapy
•	 Insulin must be given every day. Insulin injections should not be omitted because of sickness
and/or vomiting. If vomiting occurs, IV fluids may be needed to avoid hypoglycaemia
•	 During an infection, the daily requirement of insulin may rise by up to 25%.
Moderate urine ketones
•	 The extra dose of insulin is usually 10–20% of the total daily dose given as short acting
insulin every three hours.
•	 If the blood glucose drops < 8.3 mmol/L, it may be necessary to sip regular juice or other
sugar-containing drinks. This is done to raise the blood glucose before giving the next insulin
injection.
114
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Large amount of urine ketones
•	 Give 20% of the total daily insulin dose.
•	 Repeat as above if necessary.
Extra fluids
In addition to taking extra insulin, extra fluids, e.g. water and fruit juices are important to prevent
acidosis. These fluids replace the fluids lost in the urine and prevent dehydration.
Referral
In a child with inter-current illness urgent specialist advice must be obtained when:
•	 Patient is unable to carry out the advice regarding sick days;
•	 he diagnosis is unclear
•	 Vomiting is persistent, particularly in young children;
•	 Blood glucose continues to rise despite increased insulin;
•	 Hypoglycaemia is severe;
•	 Ketonuria is heavy or persistent;
•	 The child is becoming exhausted, confused, hyperventilating, dehydrated or has severe
abdominal pain.
--|Hypocalcaemia in Children
Definition
The adjusted serum calcium levels below the normal ranges (calcium is 2.2 - 2.6mmol/L).
Symptoms of hypocalcaemia, such as muscle cramps, paraesthesia, tetany and carpopedal
spasm, typically develop when serum adjusted calcium falls below 1.9mmol/L. However, this
threshold varies and symptoms also depend on the rate of fall.
The main causes of hypocalcaemia in children are:
•	 Vitamin D deficiency
•	 Calcium deficiency
•	 Magnesium deficiency
•	 Reduced parathyroid hormone production or resistance,
•	 Impaired renal function.
Diagnosis: Based on clinical signs and symptoms
Signs and symptoms of tetany include:
•	 Paraesthesia
•	 Weakness
•	 Lethargy
•	 Cramps
•	 Laryngospasm

--|Rickets
Definition
Failure to calcify osteoid tissue in a growing child, usually due to deficiency of vitamin D, its
active metabolites, calcium, phosphorus or other rare causes. This leads to bone deformity.
Occurs in ex-premature babies during infancy and in children with developmental disability, on
anticonvulsants or not exposed to sunlight. In older children it is caused by renal tubulopathy
and other rare conditions.
Diagnosis
Clinical signs
•	 Bowing of long bones, widening of metaphyses and cranial bossing.
•	 Rachitic rosary
•	 Occasionally convulsions or tetany due to hypocalcaemia.
Investigations:
•	 FBC
•	 Urea & Electrolytes, Creatinine
•	 Bone profile (Ca, Mg, Phosphate, Alkaline phosphatase)
•	 25-OH Vitamin D levels (combined vitamin D2 and D3 (where possible)
•	 X-ray of wrists
General and supportive measures
•	 Prevent vitamin D deficiency.
•	 Exposure to sunlight, at least 3 hours a week.
Note: Breast milk does not contain adequate vitamin D to prevent deficiency.
•	 Ensure adequate sunlight exposure of infant or provide vitamin D until weaning.
•	 Normal vitamin D-containing diet for lactating mothers.
118
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Medications
Prophylaxis
•	 For premature babies:
o Vitamin D, oral, 800 IU, once daily.
•	 Infants who are exclusively breastfed or not on adequate volume of commercial milk formula:
o Vitamin D, oral, 400 IU once daily.
Treatment of active rickets
•	 Treat only after confirmation of active rickets on x–ray.
•	 Vitamin D, oral, 5 000 IU once daily, in addition to milk in the diet.
•	 Repeat X–ray after 6–8 weeks.
o If no radiological improvement, further investigation is required.
o If healing occurs, continue for 3 months. Confirm complete healing and adequate diet
for the future.
Note: Children with low levels of calcium should have both calcium and Vit D. This intervention shows
a complete recovery within 3 months of supplementation.
HAEMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS
--|Anaemia
Definition
Anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) level below reference values, which vary depending
on sex, age and pregnancy status
Haemoglobin level reference ranges
•	 0-2 weeks: 12-20 g/dL
•	 2-6 months: 10-17 g/dL
•	 months-1 year: 9.5-14 g/dL
•	 1-6 years: 9.5-14 g/dL
•	 6-18 years: 10-15.5 g/dL
Causes of anaemia
•	 Decreased production of red blood cells:
o Iron deficiency, nutritional deficiencies (folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin A)
o Depressed bone marrow function, certain infections (HIV, EBV), renal failure;
•	 Loss of red blood cells
o Acute or chronic haemorrhage
•	 Increased destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis)
o Parasitic (malaria), bacterial and viral (HIV) infections
o Haemoglobinopathies (sickle cell disease, thalassaemia)
o Reaction to certain drugs (co-trimoxazole, etc.)
In tropical settings, the causes of anaemia are often interlinked.
Clinical symptoms and signs
•	 Dizziness, fainting
•	 Headache
•	 Shortness of breath on exertion (exercise intolerance)
119
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Visual disturbances
•	 Poor growth
•	 Confusion, decreased mental activity
•	 Mood or sleep disturbances
•	 Pale mucous membranes, palms and nail beds
•	 Rapid heartbeat or palpitations
•	 Dyspnoea, tachypnea
•	 Signs of heart failure if severe anaemia
•	 Other signs of severe anaemia include: Heart murmur, sweating, thirst, cold extremities,
oedema in the lower limbs and shock
•	 Some signs may indicate the likely cause of the anaemia:
o Cheilosis (cracking of the corners of the mouth) and glossitis (nutritional deficiency)
o Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, dark coloured urine (haemolysis)
o Melena, haematuria, etc. (bleeding.)
Classification of anaemia
•	 Anaemia is classified according to physiologic process (decreased production, increased
destruction or blood loss).
•	 In practice, classifying anaemia according MCV is a useful approach to assessing the
common causes of anaemia in children
Algorithm for classification of anaemia
120
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Investigations
Investigate according to clinical situation
•	 FBC, reticulocyte count and peripheral blood smear examination
•	 Blood film for malaria parasites/RDT
•	 Blood urea and serum creatinine
•	 Stool examination for eggs of hookworm, ova, parasites and occult blood,
Other tests that can be done at a tertially level depending on the clinical presentation
•	 Sickling test/ Hemoglobin electrophoresis
•	 Analysis for nutritional deficiencies
•	 Bone marrow aspiration to assess the decreased production of red cells
•	 Coombs direct and indirect (in cases of haemolytic anaemia)
•	 Iron studies (Fe, Ferritin, TIBC, transferrin % saturation)
Reticulocytes
•	 Reticulocytes are circulating immature RBC. Reticulocyte count helps to categorize the
anaemia into hypo-or hyper-proliferative type. Normal 0.5-1.5%
Hypoprolifearative:
•	 Decreased reticulocytes
•	 Bone marrow unable to produce the required number of RBC’s
•	 Lack of essential substance (iron, B12, folate) or Bone marrow infiltration such as in leukemia
, Aplastic anaemia
Hyperproliferative:
•	 Increased reticulocytes
•	 Cause of anaemia outside marrow
o Hemolytic anemia
o Hemorrhage
o Post anaemia treatment
•	 Decreased survival of RBCs
•	 Marrow normal and responds adequately by increasing the output
Corrected reticulocyte count (CRC) calculations:
•	 CRC = Reticulocyte % x (Patients’ Hematocrit/Normal hematocrit per age). A CRC >1.5
suggests increased red blood cells production as a result of haemolysis and blood loss.
Management
At health centre: Follow IMCI guidelines
Refer the child urgently if:
•	 There is severe anaemia (Hb <5), oedema or the child is very unwell
•	 Has recurrent or persistent anaemia
•	 Has severe acute malnutrition
Management at district hospital level:
•	 Obtain a detailed history from the patient or care givers
•	 Examine the anaemic patient carefully and perform the appropriate investigations with a
goal of;
o Confirming that the patient is anaemic
o Establishing the type of anaemia
o Determining the cause of the anaemia
o Determining whether or not there are complications arising from the anaemia, the cause
of the anaemia or both
121
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
o Treat or correct the underlying cause
o Always investigate cause of anaemia before initiating treatment
o In an emergency, take all blood samples before treatment
Therapeutic objectives:
•	 Treat underlying cause of anaemia
•	 In sickle cell disease patients restore haemoglobin to steady state level
•	 In iron deficiency replenish iron stores after correction of anaemia (continue to treat for 2-3
months)
Non-Pharmaceutical management:
•	 Advise on a balanced diet especially iron-rich foods such as liver; beef kidneys; molasses;
meat; sardines; eggs, fish; fresh green leafy vegetables..
•	 Malaria prevention
•	 Encourage exclusive breastfeeding until 6 months, then supplementation with iron rich food.
•	 Discourage use of cow’s milk before 12 months and excessive intake of cow’s milk.
Pharmaceutical management:
•	 For iron deficiency anaemia:
o Elemental Iron 4-6 mg/kg/day divided in 3 doses daily until the Hb has reached the
normal range.
	Ferrous Sulphate has 20% elemental iron
	Ferrous Fumarate has 33% elemental iron
	Ferrous gluconate has 12% elemental iron.
o Continue for 2-3 months after normalization of Hb to build up iron stores.
o Side effects of iron therapy: Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, constipation, or black
stools
•	 Sickle cell disease patients should receive iron tablets only if there is evidence of iron
deficiency. They should however, receive folic acid. Similarly, patients whose anaemia is
possibly due to malaria should receive folic acid
o Folic acid, oral: 5 mg every 2 days for 30 days or for as long as required.
•	 If anaemia is due to hookworms
o Albendazole:
	Children 1-2 years of age 200 mg as a single dose
	Children over 2 years of age 400 mg as a single dose
o Or Mebendazole 100 mg orally 12h x 3 days).
•	 Vitamin B12 deficiency:
o Hydroxycobalamin injection IM: Initially 100mcg/day for 10-15 days. Maintenance
dose 30-50 mcg/month. Lifelong treatment may be required.
•	 Severe anaemia with signs of cardiac failure will need treatment of the heart failure in
addition to blood.
o Transfusion with packed cells. Look for signs of decompensation before deciding to
transfuse and look for these signs during transfusion.
o Transfuse the patient if Hb < 5 g/dl and decompensation signs are present:
	 Packed cells: 10-20 ml/kg body weight slowly over 4 hours
	To calculate the volume needed to increase Hb: Volume of packed red cells =
(desired Hb – actual Hb) x weight x 0.4
o Furosemide 1mg/kg IV should be given at the beginning of transfusion:
	If signs of heart failure or
	If there is normal circulating volume, such as in chronic severe anaemia
o Make sure the CORRECT bag of blood is given and never transfuse blood that has been
out of the refrigerator for more than 2 hours.
o Make baseline recordings of temperature, respiratory rate and pulse rate, then observe
patient closely every 15 minutes for transfusion reactions

--|Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
Definition
Immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) is an immunologically mediated bleeding disorder in
which autoantibodies against platelet antigens cause premature platelet destruction that leads
to thrombocytopenia.
Children often develop ITP after a viral infection and usually recover fully without treatment.
History:
•	 A previously healthy child who has sudden onset of generalized petechiae and purpura
•	 A history of a preceding viral infection 1–4 weeks before the onset of thrombocytopenia
•	 Acute bleeding from the gums and mucous membranes
Clinical manifestations:
•	 Findings on physical examination are normal, other than the finding of petechiae and
purpura.
•	 Splenomegaly is rare, as is lymphadenopathy or pallor.
•	 Fewer than 1% of patients have intracranial hemorrhage
•	 The severity of bleeding in ITP is based on symptoms and signs, but not on platelet count
•	 Symptoms can be categorized as:
o No symptoms (identified on routine blood tests showing severe thrombocytopenia)
o Mild symptoms: bruising and petechiae, occasional minor epistaxis, very little interference
with daily living
o Moderate: more severe skin and mucosal lesions, more troublesome epistaxis and
menorrhagia
o Severe: bleeding episodes—menorrhagia, epistaxis, melena—requiring transfusion or
hospitalization, symptoms interfering seriously with the quality of life
Diagnosis:
•	 Diagnosis is based on the history, physical examination, full blood count with leukocyte
differential, and examination of the peripheral smear
Laboratory:
•	 FBC with differential (should not show any anaemia (unless significant bleeding) or anomaly
of WBC count) - Profound thrombocytopenia (platelet count <10 × 109/L).
•	 Peripheral blood film examination (will show large or giant platelets
•	 HIV test
•	 Additional investigations are done as clinically indicated
•	 Bone marrow biopsy is only indicated if the patient has other cytopenias, suspicious findings
on the peripheral smear, or other clinical features associated with bone marrow failure
syndrome
Differential diagnosis: ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion
•	 HIV infection
•	 Bacterial or viral infections
•	 Leukemia
•	 Aplastic anaemia
•	 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE
•	 Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS)) must be considered in young males found to have low
platelet counts, particularly if there is a history of eczema and recurrent infection.
125
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Management
The goal of therapy is to reduce the risk for bleeding so that patients can live a normal life
The decision to treat a child should be based on the clinical symptoms and not the platelet count.
Table 32. Management of ITP according to risk category
Risk
category Symptoms Management
Low
•	 Many petechiae or large
bruises
•	 Painless oral/palatal
petechiae or purpura.
•	 Dry blood clots in the
nostril/nares
•	 Outpatient without medical treatment (unless
significant psychosocial or safety concerns)
•	 Repeat FBC and review in 1 week
•	 Provide family education
Moderate
•	 Epistaxis >5 minutes
•	 Haematuria
•	 Haematochezia
•	 Painful oral purpura
•	 Significant menorrhagia

•	 Discuss with Paediatrician/Paed
Haematologist
•	 Transfuse with Platelets to stop bleeding
Prednisolone 2 mg/kg (max 60 mg) for 4–7
days
•	 If poor response or rapid platelet rise is
required e.g. before surgery: IVIG 0.8–1.0 g/
kg/day for 1–2 days
•	 IV Rh (D) immune globulin can be used in
Rh positive patients at a dose of 50-75
microgram/kg.
•	 Additional treatments:
o Epistaxis: oral tranexamic acid 25 mg/kg
(max 1.5 g), ENT consult where possible
o Heavy menstrual bleeding: tranexamic
acid (must not be used if haematuria is
present)
Severe
Lifethreatening
•	 Suspected internal
haemorrhage (brain,
lung, muscle, joint, etc.)
OR
•	 Mucosal bleeding that
requires immediate
intervention
•	 Urgent transfer to a tertiary hospital after
stabilisation
•	 Combination IVIG 0.8–1 g/kg and pulse IV
Methylprednisolone 15–30 mg/kg (max 1 g)
daily for 3 days
•	 Platelet transfusion 20 mL/kg, continuous if
required
IV tranexamic acid 15 mg/kg
•	 Urgent surgical intervention or referral
depending on site of bleeding
Splenectomy in ITP
•	 Splenectomy removes the primary site of platelet clearance and autoantibody production
and offers the highest rate of durable response (50% to 70%) compared with other ITP
therapies
•	 It should be reserved for 1 of 2 circumstances:
o The older child (> 4 yrs.) with severe ITP that has lasted >1 yr. (chronic ITP) and
whose symptoms are not easily controlled with steroids and IVIGs is a candidate for
splenectomy.
126
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
o Splenectomy must also be considered when life-threatening hemorrhage (intracranial
hemorrhage) complicates acute ITP, if the platelet count cannot be corrected rapidly
with transfusion of platelets and administration of IVIG and corticosteroids.
Family education
•	 On the illness/diagnosis
•	 Restrict activities to minimise the risk of head injury
o Avoid contact sports (e.g. Rugby, Soccer)
o Limit activities that have a risk for traumatic injury (e.g. Bicycle riding)
•	 Avoid anti-platelet, non-steroidal and anticoagulant medications.
•	 Avoid intramuscular injections
•	 Monitor for significant bleeding symptoms and go immediately to the emergency department
if they occur
•	 Monitor for signs of ICH and go immediately to the emergency department if head injury
or severe headache
•	 Consider discharge when family understands the condition, management, activity restrictions,
follow-up plan and when to go to the emergency department
Splenectomy in ITP
•	 Splenectomy removes the primary site of platelet clearance and autoantibody production
and offers the highest rate of durable response (50% to 70%) compared with other ITP
therapies
•	 It should be reserved for 1 of 2 circumstances:
o The older child (> 4 yrs.) with severe ITP that has lasted >1 yr. (chronic ITP) and
whose symptoms are not easily controlled with steroids and IVIGs is a candidate for
splenectomy.
o Splenectomy must also be considered when life-threatening hemorrhage (intracranial
hemorrhage) complicates acute ITP, if the platelet count cannot be corrected rapidly
with transfusion of platelets and administration of IVIG and corticosteroids.
General transfusion policy management:
Red blood cells:
 In children and adolescent:
•	 Low Hb and symptomatic
•	 Asymptomatic but Hb <5 g/dl
•	 Fever and Hb <8.0 g/dl
•	 Hb <8.0 g/dL in the perioperative period
•	 Serious infection and Hb <10.0 g/dl
o Volume packed cells necessary = 3 x weight in Kg x requested rise in Hb.
o Keep volume within limits e.g. do not transfuse 3 litre blood for chronic anaemia
•	 Postpone blood transfusion at diagnosis if WBC >100x109/l (Leukaemia is likely and high
risk of increased viscosity).
•	 In infants within the first 4 months of life:
o Hb <10 g/dL and major surgery
o Hb < 10 g/dL and pulmonary disease
 Platelets:
•	 Asymptomatic but platelets. <10.0x109/
•	 Symptomatic (petechiae, fever from serious mucositis) and platelet <20.0x109/l
•	 Before LP if platelets <30.0x109/l or DIC or high WCC.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
--|Convulsions
 (For neonatal convulsions refer to neonatal protocol)
Definition:
A convulsion is an involuntary change in movement, attention or level of awareness that is
sustained or repetitive and occurs as a result of abnormal and excessive neuronal discharges
within the brain. Convulsions may be focal (Partial) or generalised
Generalised seizures may be:
•	 Tonic-clonic,
•	 Absence (typical or atypical),
•	 Clonic,
•	 Tonic or atonic,
•	 Myoclonic
Focal seizures:
•	 Affect one part of the body but may progress to generalised tonic-clonic seizures and this
is known as secondary generalisation.
Signs & symptoms of convulsions
•	 Shaking of body; can be generalised or focal
•	 Unresponsive, eyes rolling back, biting tongue or frothing of mouth
•	 Followed by post-ictal period (sleepiness after)
128
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Causes
•	 Febrile convulsions
•	 Malaria
•	 Meningitis/Encephalitis
•	 Hypoglycaemia
•	 Hyponatraemia/ Hypernatraemia/Hypocalcaemia
•	 Epilepsy
•	 Poisoning
•	 Head injury, hypoxic injury
Investigation
•	 Bedside blood sugar level
•	 Malaria slide or Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)
•	 Full Blood count
•	 Urea, Creatinine, sodium, potassium and calcium (where possible)
•	 Consider lumbar puncture:
o If signs of meningitis (fever, neck stiffness, bulging fontanelle or irritability)
o DON’T do a lumbar puncture if the child is very sick or there are signs of raised
intracranial pressure (unequal or unresponsive pupils, papilloedema, abnormal
breathing)
Management
During seizure management
•	 Airway and Breathing: Clear airway; place child on side, protect from trauma, loosen
clothing and suction secretions if possible
•	 Make sure child is breathing; if not, give breaths using bag and mask
•	 Give oxygen
•	 Check blood sugar & treat as per the hypoglycaemia guideline
•	 Most seizures are quickly self-limited. Immediate administration of an anticonvulsant is not
systematic.
•	 If generalized seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, use diazepam to stop it:
o Diazepam
	Infants and Children 6 months to 5 years: Rectal: 0.5 mg/kg rectally without
exceeding 10 mg
	Children 6 to 11 years: Rectal: 0.3 mg/kg.
	Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Rectal: 0.2 mg/kg.
o In all cases if seizure continues, repeat dose once after 10 minutes.
o Monitor respiratory rate.
•	 If still fitting after 20 minutes
o IV Phenobarbitone (loading 20mg/kg over 15 mins, max 1g) OR
o IV phenytoin (loading dose 20mg/kg in Normal saline over 60 mins)
o If seizure continues after Phenobarbitone/Phenytoin, treat as status epilepticus.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES
--|Febrile seizures
Definition
Seizures occurring in children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years associated with a fever
but without evidence of intracranial infection or defined cause for the seizure. Febrile seizures
can be simple or complex febrile seizures.
Simple febrile seizures:
•	 Are generalised tonic-clonic seizures
•	 Are self-limiting, usually less than 5 minutes and always less than 15 minutes
•	 Cause no neurological deficit after the convulsion
•	 Have a good prognosis and very rarely develop into epilepsy
•	 Consist of only one seizure during the febrile illness which needs no specific treatment
•	 There is often a family history of febrile seizures.
Complex febrile seizures:
Febrile seizures with one or more of the following:
•	 Last longer than 15 minutes
•	 Are recurrent within the same febrile illness or occur within 24 hours
•	 Have a focal (partial) onset
•	 Have post-ictal, focal neurological abnormalities.
Risk factors for recurrent febrile seizures include:
•	 Seizure disorder in a first degree relative,
•	 Onset before 12 months of age
Diagnostic criteria
Clinical
•	 Exclude intracranial, extracranial and biochemical causes of fever or seizure.
•	 Signs of meningism are unreliable in children < 2 years of age.
•	 Treat children empirically for meningitis if suspected.
Investigations
•	 Bedside blood sugar level
•	 Malaria slide or Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)
•	 Full Blood count
•	 Urea, Creatinine, sodium, potassium and calcium (where possible)
•	 Lumbar puncture is indicated in:
o All children with clinical features of possible meningitis,
o Children where meningitis cannot be excluded, e.g. < 1 year of age or those who have
received a course of antibiotics prior to the event.
In children > 1 year of age, where a focus of extracranial infection is present and intracranial infection
such as meningitis has been excluded clinically, no further investigation is required.
Neuroimaging
•	 All children with complex febrile seizures and persistent lethargy require Brain CT scan
before doing a lumbar puncture to exclude raised intracranial pressure
•	 Based on clinical findings, investigate complex febrile seizures for possible underlying
conditions such as meningitis, focal brain lesions, cerebral malaria and epilepsy.
Note: An EEG is of no value in simple febrile seizures, but consider in recurrent complex febrile
seizures.
130
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
General and supportive measures
•	 Reassure parents and caregivers.
•	 Educate parents and caregivers regarding the first aid management of seizures.
Medicines
•	 Treat fever with Paracetamol, oral, 15 mg/kg/dose 6 hourly.
•	 If convulsing: Infants and children 6 months to 5 years: Rectal Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg without
exceeding 10 mg
Note: For children with recurrent complex febrile seizures, discuss the treatment options with a
Paediatrician.
--|Epilepsy
Definition:
Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent seizures associated with abnormal paroxysmal
neuronal discharges. When seizures are recurrent, persistent or associated with a syndrome,
then the child may be diagnosed with epilepsy.
Causes:
•	 Idiopathic (70-80%)
•	 Secondary causes:
o Cerebral dysgenesis or malformation
o Cerebral vascular occlusion
o Cerebral damage like hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE), intraventricular
haemorrhage or ischemia, head injury, infections
o Cerebral tumors
o Neurodegenerative disorders
Types of epilepsy and their clinical presentation
Infantile spasms (West’s Syndrome) Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
•	 Onset is during the first year of age
•	 Epileptic spasms (flexion and extension) associated with hypsarrhythmia on the EEG
•	 Developmental regression
•	 Child appears to stare, with a sudden flexion of the trunk and head, limbs either flung in or
out but held in a tonic spasm for a few seconds
•	 Red appearance in the face and may cry out
Generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures
Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
•	 Febrile convulsions which persist beyond 6 years
•	 Often family history of febrile convulsions
•	 Occasionally associated with afebrile convulsions
Primary generalized absence seizure of childhood (Petit mal)
Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
•	 Onset 4 - 6 years of age
•	 Short spells of motor arrest of maximum 15 seconds duration with little or no associated
movements and no post-ictal effect
131
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Benign Rolandic epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes
Clinical Signs/Symptoms
•	 Onset usually between 6–10 years but can occur before 6 years of age
•	 Sleep related events of hemi-facial clonic spasm
•	 Inability to speak with retained awareness
•	 Usually resolves by late adolescence
Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy
Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
•	 Occur in children under 1 year of age
•	 Recurrent clusters of febrile convulsions, severe neuro-regression and other non-febrile
seizures by 2-3 years of age
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
 Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
•	 Onset between 2 - 3 years of age
•	 Combination of generalized tonic clonic seizures, atypical absences, myoclonic seizures,
atonic drop attacks and occasionally complex partial seizures
•	 Behavioral problems and neuro-regression
Note: Infantile spasms, Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are
regarded as malignant forms of epilepsy and are associated with neuro-regression and behavioral
problems.
Complications:
•	 Status Epilepticus
•	 Trauma secondary to loss of consciousness during seizures
•	 Mental retardation
Diagnosis:
•	 Detailed clinical history and physical examination
Investigations:
•	 Blood work up : Full Blood count, blood sugar, malaria test, Urea, Creatinine, sodium,
potassium and calcium depending on the type of epilepsy
•	 Electroencephalogram (EEG)
•	 CT scan of the brain /MRI of the brain
Management:
Non Pharmaceutical
Acute management:
•	 Manage Airway-Breathing-Circulation-Disability and continue to monitor throughout the
seizures
•	 Place patient on side at 20 – 30° head up to prevent aspiration
•	 Monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SaO2), neurological
status, fluid balance
•	 Monitor laboratory values including blood glucose, electrolytes, if available blood gases
toxicology screen and if indicated anticonvulsant blood levels
•	 Control fever with Paracetamol with or without tepid sponging
•	 Administer oxygen to maintain SaO2 of ≥ 95%
•	 If unable to protect airway or poor ventilation, consider use of an oral airway, bag-mask
ventilation and/or intubation
•	 Admit to pediatric ward or to intensive care unit if indicated
132
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Long-term management:
•	 Minimize the impact of the epilepsy by obtaining complete seizure control to maximize
child’s full potential
•	 Educate/counsel the patient and caregiver about epilepsy and associated complications
(i.e. learning difficulties)
Pharmacological treatment in children >1 month of age:
*Please refer to neonatology protocols 3rd Edition June 2019 for management of convulsions in children
<1 month of age.
Monotherapy is preferred but combination therapy may be necessary. Combination therapy should
be initiated by or in close consultation with a pediatric specialist or neurologist. Drug levels are
rarely indicated unless there is concern about toxicity or compliance.
For acute generalized tonic clonic seizures in children > 1 month of age:
•	 Diazepam rectal 0.5 mg/kg once OR IV 0.2-0.3mg/kg once
•	 Repeat after 10 minutes same dose only once
•	 Monitor airway and breathing closely
Alternative Medications (in the absence of diazepam):
•	 Lorazepam IV 0.05- 0.1 mg/kg once, may repeat in 5 minutes for a total of 3 doses
•	 Clonazepam IV 0.1 -0.15 mg/kg loading dose by slow IV injection
•	 For refractory status epilepticus: Midazolam IV 0.1-0.3 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous
infusion starting at 1 ug/kg/minute. The infusion can be titrated upwards every 5 minutes
as needed.
If persistent seizure activity after benzodiazepines, start:
•	 Phenobarbital 15-20 mg/kg IV or by NG tube loading dose over 15minutes, may use a
dextrose containing solution. If no response after 30 minutes, may repeat a 10 mg/kg IV
loading dose.
•	 Phenytoin 15-20 mg/kg IV infused over 30 minutes in Normal saline
•	 If seizures persist after loading of dose of either Phenobarbital or Phenytoin, manage as
status epilepticus below and arrange to transfer to a centre with high dependency unit/
intensive care unit
•	 Monitor for bradycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension and pause the infusion if they occur
and restart at 2/3 of the initial loading dose.
Ongoing seizure control: Children with epilepsy require maintenance anticonvulsants

o Increase by 5 mg/kg weekly to 15–20 mg/kg/day given 8–12 hourly over 4 weeks.
o Maximum total daily dose: 40 mg/kg/day.
o Exclude liver dysfunction prior to initiating therapy (at least ALT),
o Monitor at least clinically for hepatotoxicity.
•	 Carbamazepine, oral, 5 mg/kg/dose (starting dose), 8-12 hourly.
o Increase slowly by 0.2 mg/kg at 2 weekly intervals to 5–10 mg/kg/dose 8–12 hourly.
o Usual maintenance total daily dose: 10–20 mg/kg/day.
o Maximum total daily dose: 20 mg/kg/day.
o Dosage intervals: syrup 8 hourly, tablets 12 hourly.
o Exacerbates myoclonic seizures and absence seizures..
•	 Phenobarbitone, oral, 2.5–5 mg/kg/dose as single dose at night.
o May be used in children under six months of age.
o Is not recommended as maintenance therapy for children older than 2 years due to
undesirable side effects such as sedation, behaviour disturbances, hyperkinesia and
dependence, except in situations where there is poor adherence to other drugs.
o Exacerbates absence seizures
Note:
•	 Patients not responding to these medications should be referred to a referral hospital for
possible use of second line drugs like Lamotrigine and Topiramate
•	 Avoid prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin for patients receiving
NNRTIs or PIs, as there are serious interactions involved
Referral
•	 All cases of suspected infantile spasms or myoclonic seizures.
•	 If there is concern for a secondary cause of epilepsy requiring further evaluation (examples
include brain tumors, tuberous sclerosis, brain abscess, cysticercosis, etc.). This is particularly
true in partial seizures where there may be a focal neurological problem.
•	 Seizures that are not controlled on first-line medications within 1 month.
•	 Seizures associated with neuro-regression.
•	 Mixed seizure types within one patient.
--|Convulsive status epilepticus
Definition
Status epilepticus is a generalized epileptic seizure lasting 5 or more minutes, or the presence
of two or more seizures without recovering consciousness within 30 min, or a focal seizure that
persists for >10 min, or with altered consciousness lasting for 60 min or more
Causes:
Epilepsy syndromes may present first as status epilepticus or status epilepticus may occur with
inadequate anti-epileptic drug levels
•	 CNS infection
•	 Hypoxic ischemic insult
•	 Traumatic brain injury
•	 Cerebrovascular accidents
•	 Metabolic disease including severe hypoglycemia and inborn errors of metabolism
•	 Electrolyte imbalance
134
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Intoxication
•	 Cancer including primary brain tumors and metastatic disease
Signs and Symptoms
•	 Seizure lasting > 30 minutes or repetitive seizure activity without return to baseline
consciousness.
Diagnosis
•	 Clinical evaluation
Investigations
•	 Blood work up : Full Blood count, blood sugar, malaria test, Urea, Creatinine, sodium,
potassium and calcium depending on the type of epilepsy
•	 Lumbar puncture if infectious cause is suspected.
•	 Electroencephalogram (EEG)
•	 CT scan of the brain /MRI of the brain
Complications:
•	 Hypoxic ischaemic damage to brain, myocardium and muscles
•	 Cerebral oedema
•	 Long term neurologic morbidity including persistent seizures or encephalopathy

•	 Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion
•	 Renal failure
•	 Death
Non-pharmaceutical
Acute Management:
•	 Carefully evaluate vital signs as convulsions may cause alterations in blood pressure or
interfere with breathing resulting in a decrease in oxygen saturation levels
•	 Manage Airway-Breathing-Circulation-Disability and continue to monitor throughout seizures
•	 Place patient on side at 20–30° head up to prevent aspiration
•	 Monitor heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SaO2), neurological
status, fluid balance every 15 minutes or as frequently as possible
•	 Monitor laboratory values including blood glucose, electrolytes, blood gases, toxicology
screen and if indicated anticonvulsant blood levels
•	 Control fever with Paracetamol
•	 Administer oxygen to maintain SaO2 of ≥ 95%
•	 If unable to protect airway or poor ventilation, consider use of an oral airway, bag-mask
ventilation and/or intubation
•	 Admission to intensive care if possible
Pharmacological treatment of status epilepticus
o Diazepam
	Infants and Children 6 months to 5 years: Rectal: 0.5 mg/kg rectally without
exceeding 10 mg
	Children 6 to 11 years: Rectal: 0.3 mg/kg.
	Children ≥12 years and Adolescents: Rectal: 0.2 mg/kg.
o In all cases if seizure continues, repeat dose once after 10 minutes.
o Monitor respiratory rate.
•	 If still fitting after 20 minutes
135
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
o IV Phenobarbitone (loading 20mg/kg over 15 mins, max 1g) OR
o IV phenytoin (loading dose 20mg/kg in Normal saline over 60 mins)
o If seizure continues after Phenobarbitone, load with Phenytoin or if it persists after
Phenytoin loading dose, load with Phenobarbitone if seizures continue despite the
above, transfer to ICU for Endotracheal intubation and thiopental infusion
It is important to continue to address and manage the following:
•	 ABCs
•	 Hypoxia: Administer oxygen, oral airway, bag-mask ventilation or intubation.
•	 Haemodynamic: Assess for shock or hypertension and manage accordingly.
•	 Hyperthermia: Treat with paracetamol 10-15 mg/kg orally or rectally every 4-6 hours as
required.
•	 Hypoglycemia: Treat with IV dextrose solution.
•	 Electrolyte imbalance: Assess aetiology and manage accordingly.
•	 If cerebral oedema and normal renal function, consider mannitol IV 0.5-1 gram/kg
administered over 30–60 minutes.
•	 If there is a known space-occupying lesion, consider dexamethasone IV 1-2 mg/kg IV as a
single dose then 1-1.5 mg/kg/day divided into 4 doses after discussion with a neurosurgeon
Recommendations
•	 Once status epilepticus is resolved, consider maintenance therapy with an appropriate antiepileptic drug depending on the aetiology of seizure.
•	 Referral to a specialist is always appropriate in the case of status epilepticus. If possible,
control seizures and stabilize the patient before referral. If status epilepticus has resolved,
further work-up by a neurologist may be indicated.

--|Cerebral palsy
Definition
Cerebral palsy is a group of non-progressive clinical syndromes due to brain abnormalities
from a variety of causes that is characterized by motor and postural dysfunction of varying
severity. Though it is not progressive, the appearance of the brain lesions and the clinical
manifestations may change over time as the brain matures.
Causes:
•	 The etiology of the disorder is unknown in 70% of the cases
•	 Congenital infections (TORCH)
•	 Obstetric complications leading to perinatal hypoxia (toxemia, placenta previa,
abruptio placentae, etc.)
•	 Teratogenic substances
•	 Congenital abnormalities including brain malformations and hereditary disorders
•	 Prematurity with Intracranial hemorrhage
•	 Cerebral trauma
•	 Infections (Bacterial sepsis, meningitis, herpes)
•	 Metabolic disturbances (kernicterus, severe prolonged hypoglycemia, Reye’s syndrome)
•	 Intoxication
Clinical Signs/Symptoms:
Findings are consistent with a specific CNS lesion and commonly include:
•	 Spastic syndromes : diplegia, hemiplegia, or quadriplegia
•	 Dyskinetic syndromes : athetosis, chorea or dystonia
•	 Ataxic syndromes
•	 Atonic syndromes
•	 Abnormal persistence or absence of infantile reflexes
Associated Disorders & Complications may include:
•	 Cognitive impairments. Intellectual disability, learning problems and perceptual
difficulties are common. There is a wide range of intellectual ability and children with
severe physical disabilities may have normal intelligence
•	 Psychiatric disorders : Behavioral, emotional or psychiatric disorders
•	 Epilepsy: This occurs in 45% of patients with CP and the onset is generally in the first 2
years of life.
•	 Gastro-oesophageal reflux can result in oesophagitis or gastritis, causing pain, poor
appetite and aspiration.
•	 Speech, swallowing, vision and hearing problems
•	 Constipation
•	 Drooling (poor saliva control).
•	 Incontinence. Children may be late in achieving bowel and bladder control because of
cognitive deficits or lack of opportunity to access toileting facilities because of physical
disability or inability to communicate. Some children have detrusor over activity causing
urgency, frequency and incontinence.
•	 Growth failure: This is generally due to poor nutrition.
•	 Pulmonary disease: This is usually due to chronic aspiration and chronic pulmonary
disease is a leading cause of death in patients with CP.
•	 Orthopedic disease: This includes hip and foot deformities and spinal curvatures. Patients
may have chronic back, neck, and joint pain.
138
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022
TREATMENT GUIDELINES
•	 Osteopenia: This is multifactorial related to poor nutrition, lack of motility and chronic
medication use.
•	 Visual problems e.g. strabismus, refractive errors, visual field defects and cortical visual
impairment
•	 Hearing deficits
Diagnosis:
•	 Based on history and clinical examination of the patient.
Investigations:
•	 Neuro-imaging including brain ultrasound, CT or MRI
•	 Lumbar puncture if indicated
•	 Basic lab-work to exclude other abnormalities (liver and renal function tests)
•	 Genetic screening depending on the clinical and family history
•	 Metabolic screening depending on the clinical and family history and basic lab work
•	 EEG
•	 Audiogram and visual evaluation to exclude correctable hearing or vision loss
•	 X-rays if indicated
Common reasons to come to hospital
•	 Respiratory problems particularly pneumonia
•	 Uncontrolled seizures / status epilepticus
•	 Unexplained irritability - consider acute infections, oesophagitis, dental disease, hip
subluxation, pathological fracture.
Management:
Management involves a team approach with health professionals and teachers. Input from the
family is paramount
•	 Perinatal asphyxia may be managed by passive or active hypothermia as per the
neonatology protocols.
•	 Pharmacologic management of seizures (see above)
•	 Multidisciplinary services to address and promote social and emotional development,
communication, education, nutrition, mobility and maximal independence and normal
appearance.
o Physical, occupational, and speech language therapy as necessary
o Social services provided in a variety of context to aid in the coordination of care.
o Nutritional assessment and support for those with dysphagia and/or poor growth
o Mobility aids including crutches, walkers, or wheelchairs as needed
o Surgical procedures to correct spasticity, contractures, scoliosis, or hip disorders
•	 Pharmacologic management of spasticity:
o Botulinum toxin injections: Must be done by trained provider.
o Dantrolene oral 0.5 mg/kg/dose once daily for 7 days, then increase to 1.5 mg/kg
divided 3 times/day for 7 days, then increase to 3 mg/kg/day divided 3 times/
day for 7 days, then increase to 6 mg/kg/day divided 3 times/day. Do not exceed
400 mg/day.
o Benzodiazepines: Dose varies based on medication. Diazepam may be used: If 5
years: <8.5 kg: 0.5-1 mg at bedtime; 8.5-15 kg: 1-2 mg at bedtime; >5 years:
1.25 mg given 3 times per day up to 5 mg given 4 times per day.
o Baclofen oral: <2 years: 10-20 mg divided every 3 times per day, titrate dose every
3 days in increments of 5-15 mg/day to a maximum of 40 mg daily; 2-7 years: 20-
30 mg/day divided 3 times per day, titrate dose every 3 days in increments of 5-15
139
RWANDA STANDARD TREATMENT GUIDELINES | PEDIATRICS - | 2022

mg/day to a maximum of 60 mg/day, >8 years: 30-40 mg/day divided every 8
hours, titrate dose every 3 days in increments of 5-15 mg/day to a maximum of
120 mg/day.
o Intrathecal baclofen: Requires neurosurgical intervention to place pump to deliver
medication. The benefits and complications should be discussed in detail with the
neurosurgeon.
